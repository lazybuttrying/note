# 8. Rights

- preemptive right: get the new issed stock as propotional own current stock of each investors
- right offering (privileged subscription) = share warrants 
	- each shareholder is issued rights to buy a specified number of new shares from the firm at a specified price within a specified time, after which time the rights are said to expire
- Mechanics of a Right offering
	- Questions for financial management to execute a rights offering 
		- What should the price per share be for the new stock? 
		- How many shares will have to be sold?
		- How many shares will each shareholder be allowed to buy?
		- What is likely to be the effect of the rights offering on the per-share value of the existing stock?
	- Difference between a rights offering and a general cash offer
		- how the shares are sold
	- What the firm's shareholders can do
		- exercise their rights and subscribe for some or all of the entitled shares
		- order some or all of the rights sold
		- do nothing and let the rights expire
- Number of rights needed to purchase a share
	- Number of new shares = $\cfrac{\text{Funds to be raised}}{\text{Subscription price}}$
	- Number of rights needed to buy a share of stock = $\cfrac{\text{Old shares}}{\text{New shares}}$
	- ex) This firm wants to raise 5 million dollars in new equity. Suppose the subscription price is set at 10 dollars per share but market price per share (20 dollars) are bigger. ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240106135743.png)
		- At 10 dollars per share, the firm have to issue 500,000 shares
			- 5,000,000 / 10 = 500,000
		- how many rights will be needed to buy one new share of stock: 2 rights
			- 1,000,000 / 500,000
		- Thus, a shareholder will need to give up 2 rights plus $10 to receive a share of new stock. ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240106135957.png)
			- If all the stockholders do this, National Power will raise the required $5 million.

- Ex Rights
	- ex-rights: No rights to get new stock
	- ex-rights date: The beginning of the period when stock is sold without a recently declared right
		- normally 2 trading days before the holder-of-record date.
		- holder-of-record date(date of record): The date on which existing shareholders on company records are designated as the recipients of stock rights.
		- date of record: the last day that a shareholder can establish legal ownership in a rights offering
	- Ex-Rights stock prices
		- rights on = with rights = cum rights ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240106230036.png)
	- Underwriting Arrangements
		- Standby underwriting: The type of underwriting in which the underwriter agrees to purchase the unsubscribed portion of the issue
			- protects the firm against undersubscription, which can occur 
				- if investors throw away rights
				- if bad news causes the market price of the stock to fall below the subscription price.
		- Standby fee: An amount paid to an underwriter participating in a standby underwriting agreement
		- oversubscription privilege: A privilege that allows shareholders to purchase unsubscribed shares in a rights offering at the subscription price

	- Effects on Shareholders
		- Shareholders can exercise their rights or sell them. In either case, the stockholder will neither win nor lose because of the rights offering
		- It is obvious that after the rights offering, the new market price of the firm’s stock will be lower than the price before the rights offering
		- The lower the subscription price, the greater is the price decline resulting from a rights offering
		- Because shareholders receive rights equal in value to the price drop, the rights offering does not hurt stockholders
			- , it is impossible to underprice a rights offer.
	- The rights offerings puzzle
		- right offering is costly task rather than pure rights ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240106233059.png)
		- Then when and why using it?
			- Underwriters increase the stock price
			- Underwriters provide insurance against a failed offering
			- Others
				- The proceeds of underwritten issue are available sooner than those of a rights offer
				- Underwriters provide a wider distribution of ownership than would be possible with a rights offering
				- Consulting advice from investment bankers may be beneficial

# Dilution

- Dilution: Loss in existing shareholders’ value
	- The kinds of dilution
		- Dilution of percentage owenership
			- arise whenever a firm sells shares to the general public
			- dilution of the ownership of existing shareholders can be avoided by using a rights offering
		- Dilution of market value
			- New issues and dilution ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240106234626.png)
			- dilution of proportionate ownership, accounting dilution, and market value dilution all occur
				- negative NPV causes the market price to drop, and the accounting dilution has nothing to do with it
			- USM’s stockholders appear to suffer significant losses
		- Dilution of book value and earnings per price

# 10. Issuing Long-Term Debt

- term loans: Direct business loans of one to five years maturities
- private placements: Loans, usually long-term in nature
	- provided directly by a limited number of investors
- differences between direct private long-term financing and public issues of debt
	- A direct long-term loan avoids the cost of SEC registration
	- Direct placement is likely to have more restrictive covenants
	- It is easier to renegotiate a term loan or a private placement in the event of a default
		- hard for public issue because of hudreds of holders
	- Life insurance companies and pension funds dominate the private-placement segment of the bond market
	- The costs of distributing bonds are lower in the private market
	- the interest rates on term loans and private placements are usually higher than those on an equivalent public issue
- Trade-off between a higher interest rate and more flexible arrangements in the event of financial distress, as well as the lower costs associated with private placements
- flotation costs associated with selling debt <<< the comparable costs associated with selling equity

# 11. Shelf Registration

- shelf registration: Registration permitted by SEC Rule 415
	- allows a company to register all issues it expects to sell within 2 years at one time, with subsequent sales at any time within those 2 years. (not sell at once)
- Primary qualification of Rule 415
	- The company must be rated investment grade
	- The firm cannot have defaulted on its debt in the past three years
	- The aggregate market value of the firm’s outstanding stock must be more than $150 million
	- The firm must not have had a violation of the Securities Act of 1934 in the past three years
- Dribbling of new equity issuance
	- In dribbling, a company registers the issue and hires an underwriter as its selling agent
- reason of disagreement for shelf registration
	- The costs of new issues might go up 
		- because underwriters might not be able to provide as much current information to potential investors, so investors would pay less
		- shelf registration will cause a “market overhang” that will depress market prices
