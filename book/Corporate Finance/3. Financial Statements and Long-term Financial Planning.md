# 1. Cash flow and financial statements: a closer look
Cash flow from assets = Cash flow to credictors + Cash flow to stockholders(owners) 
- Sources and uses of cash
	- sources: a firm's activites that generate cash
	- uses: application of cash 
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231221212128.png)
- Statement of cash flows

# 2. Standardized financial statements

- Common-size statements: presenting all items in "percentage" terms
- Common-base year financial statements (Trend Analysis)
	- Choose a base year and then express each item relative to the base amount
	- investigate trends in the firm's pattern of operations
		- does the firm use more or less debt?
		- has the firm grown more or less liquid?
- Combined common-size and base-year analysis ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231221213005.png)

# 3. Ratio analysis
If you are ever using ratios as a tool for analysis, you should be careful to document how you calculate each one.
Ff you are comparing your numbers to numbers from another source, be sure you know how those numbers are computed

Categoryies of Financial ratio
1. Short-term solvency, or liquidity, ratios
	1. current ratio $=\cfrac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$
		1. To a short-term credictor, the higher current ratio, the better
		2. To the firm, a high current ratio indicates...
			1. liquidity
			2. inefficient use of cash and other short-term assets
	2. quick ratio $=\cfrac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$
	3. cash ratio $=\cfrac{\text{Cash}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$
	4. NWC (net working captial to total assets) $=\cfrac{\text{Net working captial}}{\text{Total assets}}$ , low value indicate low liquidity
	5. Interval measure $=\cfrac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Average daily operating costs}}$, how long the business keep running even if strike is occured
2. Long-term solvency, or financial leverage, ratios
	1. total debt ratio $=\cfrac{\text{Total assets - Total equity}}{\text{Total assets}}$
		1. debt-equity ratio $=\cfrac{\text{Total debt}}{\text{Total equity}}$
		2. ***equity multiplier*** $=\cfrac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total equity}} = 1 + \text{Debt-Equity ratio}$ , check financial leverage
	2. Long-term debt ratio $=\cfrac{\text{Long-term debt}}{\text{Long-term debt + Total equity}}$
	3. Times interest Earned (TIE) ratio  $=\cfrac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest}}$, how well a company has its interest obligations covered 
	4. cash coverage $=\cfrac{\text{EBITDA}}{\text{Interest}}$
		1. EBITDA $= \text{EBIT + Depreciation}$
3. Asset management, or turnover, ratios
	1. Inventory Turnover and Days' Sales in Inventory
		1. Inventory turnover $=\cfrac{\text{Cost of goods sold}}{\text{Inventory}}$, the higher this ratio, the more efficiently managing inventory
			1. Days' sales in inventory $=\cfrac{\text{365 days}}{\text{inventory turnover}}$
	2. Receivables turnover $=\cfrac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Accounts receivable}}$
		1. days' sales in receivables  $=\cfrac{\text{365 days}}{\text{Receivables turnover}}$,  = ACP average collection period
	3. Asset turnover ratio  
		1. NWC turnover $=\cfrac{\text{Sales}}{\text{NWC}}$, how much work we get out of our working capital
		2. Fixed asset turnover  $=\cfrac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Net fixed assets}}$ generated sales for every dollar in fixed asset
		3. ***Total asset turnover***  $=\cfrac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Total assets}}$ , check asset use efficiency
			1. Increase total asset turnover = decrease captial intensity
4. Profitability ratios
	1. ***profit margin***  $=\cfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Sales}}$, check operating efficiency 
	2. Return on Assets (ROA)  $=\cfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}}$ 
	3. Return on equity (ROE) $=\cfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Equity}}$
		1. if ROE > ROA, the comany use financial leverage
		2.  $=\cfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Assets}} \times \cfrac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Total equity}}$
		3. $= \text{ROA} \times (1 + \text{Debt-equity ratio})$
		4. $= \text{ROA} \times \cfrac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Total Equity}}$
5. Market value ratios
	1. EPS $=\cfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shares outstanding}}$
	2. Price-Earning Ratio (PER) $=\cfrac{\text{Price per share}}{\text{Earnings per share}}$, how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current earnings
	3. Market to Book Ratio $=\cfrac{\text{Market value per share}}{\text{Book value per share}}$
		1. Notice that book value per share is total equity divided by the number of shares outstanding

# 4. Using Financial statement information

If there is a conflict between accounting and market data, market data should be given precedence

- Why evaluate financial statements?
	- internal uses
		- performance evaluation
		- planning for future
	- external uses
		- deciding whether or not to grant credit to a new customer
		- deciding to extend credit to a firm
		- evaluating competitors if they could afford the necessary development
		- acquiring
- Choosing Benchmark
	- Time-trend analysis
		- By investigating, find the possible explanations on the decline in financial statement
	- Peer Group Analysis
		- Peer group: identify firms similar in the sense that they compete in the same markets
			- SIC codes: Standard Industrial Classification
				- not perfect to divide firms
		- Aspirant group: identify a set of primary competitors, not the average firm 
- Problems with Financial Statement Analysis = (Difficult to compare)
	- Do not fit any neat industry category
		- Many firms are conglomerates, owning unrelated lines of business
		- Major competitors and natural peer group member in an industry may be scattered around the globe
	- Existence of difference standards, procedures, and times
