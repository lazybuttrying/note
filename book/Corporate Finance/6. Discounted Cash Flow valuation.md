# 1. Future and Present values of multiple cash flows
- Cash flow timing: Cash flow occur at the "end" of each period
- Future value
	- calculated by compounding forward 1 period at a time ![](Pasted%20image%2020231224014627.png)
	- calculated by compounding each cash flow separately ![](Pasted%20image%2020231224014636.png)
- Present value
	- calculated by discounting back 1 period at a time ![](Pasted%20image%2020231224014811.png)
	- calculated by discounting each cash flow separately ![](Pasted%20image%2020231224014801.png)

# 2. Valuing level cash flows: annuities and perpetuities

annuity: a level stream of cash flows for a fixed period of time ![](Pasted%20image%2020231225004514.png)
- annuity cash flows
	- C: cash flows (usually every year)
	- Annuity present value = $C \times \cfrac{1 - \text{Present value factor}}{r}$ = $C \times \cfrac{1 - \cfrac{1}{(1+r)^t}}{r}$
		- PVIFA(r, t) = Present value interest factor for annuities
	- Annuity future value = $C \times \cfrac{\text{Future value factor} - 1}{r}$ = $C \times \cfrac{(1+r)^t - 1}{r}$
	- Annuity due: an annuity for which the cash flows occur at the "beginning" of each period
		- ex) lease, arrangement to prepay the same amount each period
		- Annuity due value = $\text{Ordinary annuity value} \times (1+r)$
- Perpetuity(Console)
	- = An annuity in which the "cash flows continue forever"
		- It has an infinite number of cash flows, we obviously cannot compute its  value by discounting
		- ex) Perferred stock (preference stock): get a fixed cash dividend every period forever
	- Present value for a perpetuity $= \cfrac{C}{r}$

# 3. Comparing rates: the effect of compounding

- Stated interest rate: expressed in terms of the interest payments made in each period. also  called quoted interest reate
- EAR(effective annual rate): expressed as if it were compounded once per year
	- $= (1+\cfrac{\text{Quoted rate}}{m})^m - 1$, where $m = \cfrac{365}{days}$. 
		- if quaterly, m is 4. if monthly, m is 12 
		- There is an upper limit to the EAR ($e^q -1$) following exponential function ![](Pasted%20image%2020231225011211.png)
	- ex) 15.5% compounded quarterly -> acually paying $15.5\%/4=3.875\%$ per quater -> investment 1 dollar per 4 quaters $1\$ \times (1 + 3.875\%)^4 = 1.1642 \$$ -> EAR is 16.42%
- APR(annual percentage rate): charged per period multiplied by the number of periods per year
	- ex) if a loan is charging 1.2% per month , then ARP is reported at $1.2\% \times 12 = 14.4\%$ 
		- In this case, $\text{EAR}= (1+\cfrac{\text{APR}}{12})^12 - 1 = 1.01^{12}-1 = 12.6825\%$

# 4. Loan types and loan amortization

- Pure discount loads
	- borrower receives money today, repays a single lump sum at some time in the future
	- ex) borrowing 25000 dollars for 5 years at 12% interest, the present value is $25000/1.12^5$
	- ex) treasury bills (short-term)
- Interest-only loans
	- borrower pays interest each period and to rebay the entire principal at some point in the future
	- ex) borrwoing 1000 for 3 years at 10% interest, repayment at end is $1000 + (1000 \times 10\%) \times 3$
	- ex) most corporate bonds
- Amortized loans
	- borrower repays parts of the loan amount over time
	- ex) borrowing 5000 for 5 years at 9% interest, Interest paid of each year is beginning balance multiplied by 9% ![](Pasted%20image%2020231225013009.png)
		-  $5000\$ = C \times \cfrac{1 - \cfrac{1}{(1+0.09)^5}}{0.09}$ gives us $C=1285.46\$$![](Pasted%20image%2020231225013550.png)
