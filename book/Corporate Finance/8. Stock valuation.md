# 1. Common stock valuation

- Cash flow
	- $P_0 = \cfrac{D_1 + P_1}{1+R}$, $P_1 = \cfrac{D_2 + P_2}{1+R}$, then $P_0 = \cfrac{D_1 + \cfrac{D_2+P_2}{1+R}}{1+R}$
	- Therefore $P_0 = \cfrac{D_1}{(1+R)^1} + \cfrac{D_2}{(1+R)^2} \ ...$: 
		- Price of the stock today is equal to the present value of all future dividends
		- How many future dividends are there? Answer is infinite.
		- Thus, valuation is difficult
- Some special cases
	- zero growth: $P=\cfrac{D}{R}$
		- $P_0 = \cfrac{D}{(1+R)^1} + \cfrac{D}{(1+R)^2} \ ...$ , constand dividends
	- constant growth: present value = $\cfrac{C_1}{R-g} = \cfrac{C_0(1+g)}{R-g}$
		- $D_1 = D_0 \times (1+g)$ where g is growth rate
		- $D_1 = D_1 \times (1+g) = D_0 \times (1+g)^2$
		- Therefore $D_t = D_0 \times (1+g)^t$
		- dividend growth model: the present value(price) of this series of cash flows(stock) 
			- $P_t = \cfrac{D_t \times (1+g)}{R-g} = \cfrac{D_{t+1}}{R-g}$
	- Nonconstant growth
		- The case of supernormal growth rates over some finite length of time
		- In this case, $P_0 = \cfrac{D_1}{(1+R)^1} + \cfrac{D_2}{(1+R)^2} + \cfrac{D_3}{(1+R)^3} + \cfrac{P_3}{(1+R)^3}$, where $P_t = \cfrac{D_t \times (1+g)}{R-g}$ ![](resource/ Pasted%20image%2020231226203152.png)
- Components of the required return
	- Required return = dividend yield + capital gains yield(growth rate)
		- $R= \cfrac{D_1}{P_0} + g$


# 2. Some features of common and preferred stocks

- common stock 
	- shareholder right: one share, one vote
		- In general, if there are N directors up for election, then 1/(N+1)% of the stock + 1 share will guarantee you a seat
		- Cumulative voting: shareholder may cast all votes for 1 member of board of directors
			- permit minority participation
		- Straight voting: shareholder may cast all votes for EACH member of board of directors 
			- freeze out minoirty shareholders
		- Staggered election
			- Effect 1: difficult for minority to elect a director on cumulative voting because of fewer directors to elect
			- Effect 2: takeover attempts less successful because of difficulty to vote in majority of new directors
			- Effect 3: continuity on the board of directors -> long-range plans
	- Proxy Voting
		- proxy: the grant of authority by a shareholder allowing another individual to vote his/her shares (usually voting in large public corporation)
		- proxy fight: attempt to replace management by electing enough directors
	- Classes of stock
		- Reason for creating multiple calsses of stock has to do with control of the firm
	- Other rights:
		- Preemptive right: company that wishes to sell stock must first offer it to the existing stockholders before offering it to the general public
	- Dividends' feature
		1. Unless a dividend is declared by the board of directros, it is not a liability of the corporation
		2. it it not a business expense and not tax deductible
		3. dividends received by individual shareholders are fully taxable. But in corporation taxed only on the 30% taxable
- Preferred Stock
	- preferred stocks is treated as debt for tax purpose, but it is a kind of equity bond
	- Preferred shareholders receive a stated dividend only, and if the corporation is liquidated, preferred shareholders get a stated value
		- stated value = liquidating value, usually 100 dollars per share
			- ex) 5 dollars preferred = dividend yield of 5% of stated value
	- most dividends payable on prefferred stock are ***cumulative*** (arrearage)
	- Sometimes, preferred stock is ***convertible*** into common stock (callable)
