- cash cycle depends on the inventory, receivables, and payables periods
	- The cash cycle increases as the inventory and receivables periods get longer
	- It decreases if the company is able to defer payment of payables and thereby lengthen the payables period
- A lengthening cycle can indicate that the firm is having trouble moving inventory or collecting on its receivables
- Thus, all other things being the same, the shorter the cash cycle is, the lower is the firm’s investment in inventories and receivables. 
- As a result, the firm’s total assets are lower, and total turnover is higher.
