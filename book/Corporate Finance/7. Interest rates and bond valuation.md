# 1. Bonds and Bonds Valuation
- Bond Features 
	- Coupon: stated interest payment made on a bond
		- Coupon rate: the annual coupon divided by the face value of a b ond
	- Face value: the principal amount of a bond that is repaid at the end of the term. also called par value
	- Maturity: specified date on which the principal amount of a bond is paid
		- Once bond has been issued, the number of years to maturity declines as time goes by
		- YTM(yield to maturity): The rate required in the market on a bond
- Bond Values and Yields
	- Bond value = Present value of the face amount + Present Value of the coupons
		- = $C \times \cfrac{1-\cfrac{1}{(1+r)^t}}{r} + \cfrac{F}{(1+r)^t}$
			- F is a face value paid at maturity
			- C is coupon paid per period
			- t is periods to maturity
			- r is yield per period
		-  Present Value of the coupons = Annuity present value
	- ex) present value of 1000 dollars in 10 years at 8% rate. the bond offers coupon as 80 dollars per year![](Pasted%20image%2020231225153534.png)
		- Present value = $\cfrac{1000\$}{(1+0.08)^{10}} = 463.19\$$ 
		- Annuity present value = $80\$ \times \cfrac{1- \cfrac{1}{(1+0.08)^{10}}}{0.08}=536.80\$$
		- Total bond value = $463.19\$ + 536.81\$ = 1000\$$
	- ex) What if the bond has 9 years to maturity and market interest rate rised to 10%?
		- Then present value of 1000 dollars in 9 years at 10% rate, coupon as 80 dollars per year
		- Present value = $\cfrac{1000\$}{(1+0.10)^{9}} = 424.10\$$ 
		- Annuity present value = $80\$ \times \cfrac{1- \cfrac{1}{(1+0.10)^{9}}}{0.10}=460.72\$$
		- Total bond value = $424.10\$ + 460.72\$ = 884.82\$$ -> discounted bond
- Interest Rate Risk
	- How much interest rate risk a bond has depends on how ***sensitive*** its price is to interest rate changes (All other things being equal...)
		- the lower the coupon rate, the greater the interest rate risk 
		- the longer the time to maturity, the greater the interest rate risk ![](Pasted%20image%2020231225160833.png)
- Finding YTM: More trial and error
	- r is YTM and unkown discount rate
		- Bond Value = Coupon $\times \cfrac{1 -\cfrac{1}{(1+r)^{\text{year}}}}{r} + \cfrac{\text{Face value}}{(1+r)^\text{year}}$ 

# 2. More on bond features

- Main differences between debt and equity
	- Debit and Creditor do not have voting power
	- Corporation's payment of interest on debt is cost and tax deductible. But dividends are not tax deductible
	- Unpaid debt is a liability of the firm. When equity is issued, the possibility of financial failure does not arise

- Indenture (deed of trust)
	- legal document as the written agreement between corporation and the lender detailing the terms of the debt issue
	- Terms of Bond
		- Registered form: the form of bond issue in which the registrar of the company records ownership of each bond; payment is mad directly to the owner of record
		- Bearer form: the form of bond issue in which the bond is issued without record of the owner's name; payment is made to whoever holds the bond
	- Debt Security
		- debenture: an unsecured debt, usually with a maturity of 10 years or more
		- note: an unsecured debt, usually with a maturity under 10 years
	- Seniority: preference in position over other lenders, labeled as senior or junior
	- Repayment
		- Sinking fund: an account managed by the bond trustee(bank) for early bond redemption
	- Call provision 
		- : an agreement giving the corporation the option to ***repurchase*** the bond at a specified price prior to maturity
		- Call premium: The amount by which the **call price exceeds** the par value of the bond
		- deferred call provision: a call provision **prohibiting the company from redeeming** the bond prior to a certain date
		- call protected bond: a bond that, during a certain period, cannot be redeemed by the issuer
	- Protective Covenants
		- A part of the indenture limiting certain actions that might be taken during the term of the loan, usually to protect the lender's interest

# 3. Bond ratings

bond rating is only concerned the event of default
Do not care the interest rate risk

# 4. Some different types of bonds

- Government bonds
- Zero Coupon bonds : no coupon -> initially priced at a deep discount
	- no interest -> no tax on interest 
- floating-rate bonds (floaters)
	- the coupon payments are adjustable: ex) inflation-linked bond
	- Put provision: Holder's right is to redeem own note at par value on the coupon payment date after some specified amount of time
	- Capped coupon rate: the coupon rate has minimum and maximum
		- Collar: the upper and lower rates
- other types of bond
	- income bond: bond except coupon dependent on company's income
	- convertible bond: can be swapped for shares of stock
	- put bond: allows the holder to force to issuer to buy the bond back at a stated price

# 5. Bond market
Bond price reporting
- bid price: the price a dealer is willing to pay for a security
- asked price: the price a dealer is willing to take for a security
- bid-ask spread: the difference between the bid price and the asked price

# 6. Inflation and interest rates

- real rates: rates adjusted for inflation
	- The percentage change in how much you can buy with your dollars (buying power)
- nominal rates: not adjusted 
	- The percentage change in the number of dollars you have
- inflation premium: extra compensation
	- interest rate risk premium: the compensation investors demand for bearing interest rate risk
- Fisher effect: $1+R = (1+r) \times (1+h)$, -> $R \approx r+h$
	- R: nominal rate 
	- r: real rate
	- h: inflation rate
- Terms structure of interest rates:  nominal interest rates on default-free, pure discount securities and time to maturity (the pure time value of money)
	- pure means no risk of default and lump-sum future payment ![](Pasted%20image%2020231226180146.png)
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020231227151158.png)
- Treasury yield curve: a plot of the yields on Treasury notes and bonds relative to maturity
	- It depends on the real rate, expected future inflation, and the interest rate risk premium 
	- Treasury have 3 important features:
		1. default-free -> if not, default risk premium, compensation for possibility of default
		2. taxable -> if not, taxability premium, compensation for unfavorable tax status
		3. highly liquid -> if not, liquidity premium, compensation for lack of liquidity
