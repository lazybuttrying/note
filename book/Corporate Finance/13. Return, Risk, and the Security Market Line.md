# 1. Expected Return and Variances

- Expected Return ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231229193553.png)
	- Risk premium = Expected Return - Risk free rate
		- if risk free rate is 8%, the risk premium of stock U...
			- $E(R_U)-R_f = 20\%-8\%=12\%$
- Variance
	- ex) In a given year, stock U will actually return 30% or 10% ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231229194144.png)
		- deviations are (30-20)=10% in boom or (10-20)=-10% in recession
		- Variance = $\sigma^2 = .50 \times (10\%)^2 + .50 \times (-10\%)^2 = .01$
		- Standard deviation = $\sigma = \sqrt{.01} =.10 = 10\%$

# 2. Portfolios

- portfolio: a group of assets such as stocks and bonds held by an investor
- portfolio weight: a percentage of a portfolio's total value that is in a particular asset

- Portfolio expected returns
	- ex) The portfolio weights are obviously .50 and .50. ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231229194743.png)
		- In recession, half your money loses 20%, and other half gains 30%
		- In boom,  half your money gains 70%, and other half gains 10%
	- $E(R_p) = x_1 \times E(R_1) + x_2 \times E(R_2) + ... + x_n \times E(R_n)$
- Portfolio Variance
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231229195012.png)


# 3. Announcements, Surprises, and Expected returns

- Total return = Expected return + Unexpected return
	- $R=E(R) +U$
		-  Through time, the average value of U will be 0: $R = E(R)$
	- Expected Return: depends on...
		- the information shareholders have
		- market's understanding today of the imfortant factors that will influence the stock in the coming year
	- Unexpected Return: Uncertain or risky part
		- News, Government figures (GDP), latest arms control talks, sales figures are higher than expected, A sudden or unexpected drop in interest rates
			- $\text{Announcement} = \text{Expected part} + \text{Surprise}$
				- If the annoucement is same as the forecast, it is not news. No impact on the stock price as a result. (already discounted)
				- if not, we called it as innovation or surprise

# 4. Risk: Systematic and Unsystematic

- systematic risk: a risk that influences a large number of assets. (market risk)
- unsystematic risk: a risk that affects at most a small number of assets. (assset-specific risk, unique risk)
- actual return $R = E(R) + \text{Systematic portion} + \text{Unsystematic portion}$
	- $R = E(R) + m + \epsilon$

# 5. Diversification & Portfolio Risk

- principle of diversification: Spreading an investment across a number of assets will eliminate some, but not all, of the risk
	- Unsystematic risk is eliminated by diversification

# 6. Systematic Risk and Beta

- beta coefficient: the amount of systematic risk present in a particular risky asset relative to that in an average risky asset
	- average asset has a beta of 1.0 relative to itself
	- An asset with beta of 0.50 has half systematic risk 
	- An asset with beta of 0.50 has twice systematic risk 
		- Larger Beta, Greater systematic risk, Greater expected returns
- Be careful! Security A has greater total risk, but it has less systematic risk ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231230011233.png)

- Portfolio Betas
	- stock A has beta of .80 and stock B has beta of 1.65
	- the investment weights are 50:50
	- Then protfolio beta $\beta_P = .50 \times \beta_A + .50 \times \beta_B$

# 7. Security Market Line

Consider a portfolio made up of Asset A (25%) and a risk-free asset (1-25%)
- $E(R_P) = .25 \times E(R_A) + (1-.25)\times R_f$
- $\beta_P=.25 \times \beta_A + (1-.25)\times0$
![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231230012908.png)


- Fundamental result: reward-to-risk ratio(slope) must be the same for all the assets in the market
	- $\cfrac{E(R_A)-R_f}{\beta_A} =\cfrac{E(R_B)-R_f}{\beta_B}$
	- Because this buying and selling continue until the two assets plotted on exatly the same line,
		- It means they offer the same reward for beraing risk
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231230014125.png)

- Security Market Line (SML)
	- A positively sloped straight line displaying the relationship between expected return and beta
		- SML tells us the reward for bearing risk in financial markets
		- Market portfolio: a portfolio made up of all of the assets in the market
			- expected return $E(R_M)$
			- Beta $\beta_M=1$
	- SML slope $= \cfrac{E(R_M)-R_f}{\beta_M} = E(R_M)-R_f$
		- market risk premium = $E(R_M)-R_f$
	- Why SML?
		- compare (the expected return on that new investment) to (what the financial market offers on an investment with the same beta)
			- whether or not an investment has a positive NPV

- Captial Asset Pricing Model
	- $E(R_i) = R_f + [E(R_M) - R_f] \times \beta_i$
	- What the CAPM shows is that the expected return for particular asset depends on...
		- Pure time value of money
			- measured by risk free rate $R_f$
			- it is reward for merely waiting for your money, without taking any risk
		- Reward for bearing systematic risk
			- measured by market risk premium $E(R_M)-R_f$
		- Amount of systematic risk
			- measured by beta $B_i$

# 8.  Cost of Capital

= the minmum required return on a new investment (break-even)
