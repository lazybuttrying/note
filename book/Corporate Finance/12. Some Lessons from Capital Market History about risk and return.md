# 5. Capital Market Efficiency

- efficient capital market: a market in which security prices reflect available information
	- There is no reason to believe that the current price is too low or too high
- EHM efficient markets hypothesis: actual capital markets are efficient
	- Because of competition among investors
		- profit motive: powerful incentive for knowing any particular company
	- All investments in the market are 0 NPV 

- The form of market efficiency
	- Weak form efficient
		- current price of stock reflects the stock's own past prices
		- Do not searching for patterns in historical prices to identifying mispriced stocks
	- Semistrong form efficient
		- All public information is reflected in the stock price
		- There is inside information not reflected in the price of the stock
	- Strong form efficient
		- all information of every kind is reflected in stock prices
- Market is efficent, because
	- Prices do appear to respond very rapidly to new information, and the response is at least not grossly different form expectation
	- The future of market prices, in short-run, is very difficult to predict based on public information
	- If mispriced stocks do exist, then there is no obvious means of identifying them
