! Capital structure decisions: about debt-equity ratio
to maximizes the value of firm and a share of stock



# 1. Capital Structure Question

- Firm Value and Stock Value 
	- Change in the value of the firm is the same as the net effect on the stockholders ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107135638.png)
- Capital structure and the cost of capital
	- the value of firm is maximized when the WACC is minimized
		- because values and discount rate of cash flows(WACC) moves in oppostie direction
	- optimal capital structure(target captial structure): results in lowest WACC


# 2. The effect of financial leverage

No debt = No financial leverage

- The basics of financial leverage
	- Financial Leverarge, EPS and ROE ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107141517.png)
	- EPS vs EBIT
		- At break-even point, EPS is equal to no-debt case and with-debt case
		- When EBIT is relatively high, leverage is beneficial
		- $\text{EBIT}/400,000 = (\text{EBIT}-400,000\$)/200,000$ ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107141924.png)
- Corporate Borrowing and Homemade Leverage
	- homemade leverage: The use of personal borrowing to change the overall amount of financial leverage to which the individual is exposed
	- investors can always increase financial leverage themselves to create a different pattern of payoffs. It thus makes no difference whether or not the firm choose the proposed capital structure (always debt-equity ratio = 1) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107143128.png)

# 3. Capital Structure and the cost of equity capital

- M&M Proposition I
	- = The proposition that the value of the firm is independent of the firm’s capital structure
	- Pie Model ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107184642.png)
- The Cost of Equity and Financial Leverage: M&M Proposition II
	- = The proposition that a firm’s cost of equity capital is a positive linear function of the firm’s capital structure.
		- $R_E = R_A + (R_A-R_D)\times (D/E)$ ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107185241.png)
			- from $WACC = (E/V) \times R_E + (D/V) \times R_D$ where $V= E+D$
			- $R_A$(=WACC): the required return on the firm's overall assets 
			- $R_D$: the firm's cost of debt
			- $D/E$: debt-equtiy ratio
- Busienss and Financial Risk
	- business risk: The equity risk that comes from the nature of the firm’s operating activities
		- The greater a firm’s business risk, the greater RA will be, and, all other things being the same
		- the greater will be the firm’s cost of equity
	- financial risk The equity risk that comes from the financial policy (i.e., capital structure) of the firm
		- = extra risk that arises from the use of debt financing 
			- As the firm begins to rely on debt financing, the required return on equity rises

# 4. M&M Proposition I and II with corporate taxes

what happens to M&M Propositions I and II when we consider the effect of corporate taxes

- ex) Firm U (unlevered) and Firm L (levered). These two firms are identical on the left-hand side of the balance sheet, so their assets and operations are the same ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107191853.png)
- Interest Tax Shield
	- = The tax saving attained by a firm from interest expense
	- Assume) depreciation is 0, capital spending is 0, No changes in NWC, corporate tax rate is 30% 
		- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107192448.png)
- Taxes and M&M Proposition I
	- The value of the tax shield 24 dollars by paying interest at 8%: 
		- $PV=T_C \times D= .30 \times 1000\$ = 300\$$
			- $T_C$: corporate tax rate
			- $D$: EBIT

	- The value of the firm increases as total debt increases because of the interest tax shield
		- $V_L = V_U  + T_C \times D$
			- $R_U$: unlevered cost of capital:
				- The cost of capital of a firm that has no debt
			- $V_U$: The value of the unlevered firm
				- $V_U = \cfrac{EBIT \times (1 -T_C)} {R_U}$
			- $V_L$: The value of the levered firm ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107195819.png)
- Taxes, WACC, and Proposition II
	- Proposition II with corporate taxes states that the cost of equity is
		- $R_E = R_U + (R_U - R_D) \times (D/E)  \times (1 - T_C)$
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107200122.png)


# 5. Bankruptcy costs

Bankrupt: when value of its asset = value of its debt, the value of equity is 0

Bankrupt occured -> ownership of the firm’s assets is ultimately transferred from the stockholders to the bondholder

- Direct Bankruptcy Costs
	- The costs that are directly associated with bankruptcy, such as legal and administrative expenses, tax

- Indirect bankruptcy costs 
	- The costs of avoiding a bankruptcy filing incurred by a financially distressed firm
		- financial distress costs: The direct and indirect costs associated with going bankrupt or experiencing financial distress.
	- ex) Valuable employees leave, potentially fruitful programs are dropped to preserve cash, and otherwise profitable investments are not taken

- Until the firm is legally bankrupt, the stockholders control it
- The bondholders are primarily concerned with protecting the value of the firm’s assets and will try to take control away from stockholder

# 6. Optimal Capital Structure

- static theory of capital structure
	- The theory that a firm borrows up to the point where the tax benefit from an extra dollar in debt is exactly equal to the cost that comes from the **increased probability of financial distress**
	- The gain from the tax shield on debt is offset by financial distress costs.
		- An optimal captial structure exists that just balances the additional gain from leverage against the added financial distress cost
			- Optimal capital structure = $D^*/V_L^*$ in debt and $(1-D^*/V_L^*)$ in equity 
		- the difference between the static theory value of the firm and the M&M value with no taxes is ***the gain from leverage, net of distress costs***.![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107224528.png)
- Optimal Capital Structure and the Cost of Capital
	- WACC falls initially because of the tax advantage of debt
		-  Decilnes at first, because the aftertax cost of debt is cheaper than equity
	- Beyond the point $D^*/E^*$, it begins to rise because of financial distress costs ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107225014.png)

	- We can find optimal debt level $D^*$, optimal debt-to-equity ratio $D^*/E^*$, and lowest possible $\text{WACC}^*$   ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107230621.png)
- Capital Structure: Some managerial recommendations
	- taxes
		- tax benefit from leverage
		- Not all firms have the same tax rate
			- The higher the tax rate, the greater the incentive to borrow
	- financial distress
		- Firms with a greater risk of experiencing financial distress will borrow more
		- all other things being equal, the greater the volatility in EBIT, the less a firm should borrow
		- For example, a firm with mostly tangible assets that can be sold without great loss in value will have an incentive to borrow more. For firms that rely heavily on intangibles, such as employee talent or growth opportunities, debt will be less attractive because these assets effectively cannot be sold.

# 7. The Extended Pie Model

the value of all the claims against the firm’s cash flows is not affected by capital structure, 
but the relative values of claims change as the amount of debt financing is increased.

![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240107232352.png)

- the value of government's claim $G$
- cash flow of the firm $CF$
	- = Payments to stockholders + Payments to creditors + Payments to the government + Payments to bankruptcy courts and lawyers + Payments to any and all other claimants to the cash flows of the firm

- Marketed Claims vs Nonmarketed Claims
	- marketed claims $V_M$ can be bought and sold in financial markets 
		- affected by changes in the capital structure
	- the nonmarketed claims $V_N$ cannot
		- taxes and bankruptcy costs
	- total value of all the claims $V_T = V_M+V_N = E+D+G+B+ ...$
		- The optimal capital structure is thus the one that maximizes the value of the marketed claims, and minimizes the value of nonmarketed claims

# 8. Observed Capital structures

most corporations seem to have relatively low debt-equity ratios
much less debt financing than equity financing

issued debt up to the point that tax shelters have been completely used up, and we conclude that there must be limits to the amount of debt corporations can use

# 9. A quick look at the bankruptcy process

- bankruptcy: A legal proceeding for liquidating or reorganizing a busines
- ways
	- Business failure
		- situation in which a business has terminated with a loss to creditors, but even an all-equity firm can fail
	- Legal bankruptcy 
		- Firms or creditors bring petitions to a federal court for bankruptcy
		- Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding for liquidating or reorganizing a business
	- Technical insolvency
		- occurs when a firm is unable to meet its financial obligations.
	- Accounting insolvency
		- Firms with negative net worth are insolvent on the books
		- This happens when the total book liabilities exceed the book value of the total assets
- Bankrupty Liquidation: Termination of the firm as a going concern
	- typcial event
		- A petition is filed in a federal court. Corporations may file a voluntary petition, or involuntary petitions may be filed against the corporation by several of its creditors
		- A trustee-in-bankruptcy is elected by the creditors to take over the assets of the debtor corporation. The trustee will attempt to liquidate the assets
		- When the assets are liquidated, after payment of the bankruptcy administration costs, the proceeds are distributed among the creditors
		- If any proceeds remain, after expenses and payments to creditors, they are distributed to the shareholders
	- prioirity list to distribute the proceeds (net of selling costs)
		- Administrative expenses associated with the bankruptcy 
		- Other expenses arising after the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition but before the appointment of a trustee
		- Wages, salaries, and commissions 
		- Contributions to employee benefit plans 
		- Consumer claims 
		- Government tax claims 
		- Payment to unsecured creditors
		- Payment to preferred stockholders
		- Payment to common stockholders
	- APR (absolute prioirty rule): higher a claim is on this list, the more likely it is to be paid
- Bankrupty Reorganization: Financial restructuring of a failing firm to attempt to continue operations as a going concern
	- terminate its existing labor agreements, lay off large numbers of workers, and slash wages for the remaining employees.
	- typical events
		- A voluntary petition can be filed by the corporation, or an involuntary petition can be filed by creditors
		- A federal judge either approves or denies the petition. If the petition is approved, a time for filing proofs of claims is set
		- In most cases, the corporation (the “debtor in possession”) continues to run the business
		- The corporation (and, in certain cases, the creditors) submits a reorganization plan
		- Creditors and shareholders are divided into classes. A class of creditors accepts the plan if a majority of the class agrees to the plan
		- After its acceptance by creditors, the plan is confirmed by the court
		- Payments in cash, property, and securities are made to creditors and shareholders. The plan may provide for the issuance of new securities
		- For some fixed length of time, the firm operates according to the provisions of the reorganization plan.
	- prepackaged bankruptcies: (prepack)
		- the corporation secures the necessary approval of a bankruptcy plan from a majority of its creditors first, and then it files for bankruptcy
		- As a result, the company enters bankruptcy and reemerges almost immediately
	- Cram-down power of bankruptcy court: Under certain circumstances, a class of creditors can be forced to accept a bankruptcy plan even if they vote not to approve it

- Why bankruptcy is valuable?
	- "Stay": await the outcome of the bankruptcy process to find out if and how much they will be paid
	- Beyond this, some bankruptcy filings are actually strategic actions intended to improve a firm’s competitive position (reorganization)
	- filed for bankruptcy because of expected future losses resulting from litigation
- Agreements to Avoid Bankruptcy
	- Workout: avoids a bankruptcy filing
	- reschedule: postpones the date of payment or composition, which involves a reduced payment.
