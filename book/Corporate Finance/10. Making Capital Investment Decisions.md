# 1. Project cash flows: a first look
- incremental cash flows: difference a firm's future cash flows with a project and those without projec
- stand-alone principle: assumption that evaluation of a project may be based on the project's incremental cash flows
	- view the project as a kind of "minifirm" with its own future revenues and cost, own assets

# 2. Incremental cash flows

- suck cost: cost already been incurred and cannot be removed and therefore should not be considered in an investment decision
- opportunity costs: the most valuable alternative given up if a particular investment is undertaken
- erosion: cash flows of a new project that come at the expense of a firm's existing projects
- net working capital: the firm supplies working capital at the beginning and recovers it towards the end
	- Don't worry about some credit sales and the some cost not paid, because we include "changes" in NWC
- financing cost: Interest paid is a component of cash flow to creditors, not cash flow from asset. thus in analyzing a proposed investment, interest paid or financing cost(dividends) are not included
- "aftertax" cash flow

# 3. Pro forma financial statements and project cash flows

Pro forma financial statements: financial statements projecting future years' operations

- Project cash flow 
	- = Project operating cash flow (inflow) - Project change in net working captial (outflow) - Project captial spending
		- Operating cash flow = Earnings before interest and taxes(EBIT) + Depreciation - Taxes
			- operating cash flow = EBIT when no taxes or depreciation

- EX)  Assumed that all the cash flows occured at end of year ![](Pasted%20image%2020231227210718.png)
	- NPV at 20% required return = $(-110,000) + \cfrac{51,780}{(1+0.2)} + \cfrac{51,780}{(1+0.2)^2} + \cfrac{71,780}{(1+0.2)^3}$
		- = 10,648 dollar 
		- IRR is 25.8%, setting NPV=0
	- AAR = net income / average book value = 21780 / 65000 =33.51%

# 4. Depreciation

- ACRS: accelerated cost recovery system: A depreciation method under US tax law allowing for the accelerated write-off of property under vairous classfications
	- Asset's class establish for tax purposes, so uses book value not market value
		- Class 3 year: equipment used in research
		- class 5 year: autos, computers
		- class 7 year: most industrial equipment
- MACRS: modified ACRS depreciation ![](Pasted%20image%2020231227212737.png)
- ex) ![](Pasted%20image%2020231227214715.png) ![](Pasted%20image%2020231227220336.png)
	- NPV = - initial investment + discounted flows at 15%
		- = 65.488 dollars > 0: it's rate of return will be greater than 15% => acceptable
	- payback = 4.08 years (4 + 17322/214)


# 5. Alternative definitions of operating cash flow
- bottom-up approach: $\text{OCF} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation}$
- top-down approach: $\text{OCF} = \text{Sales} + \text{Costs} - \text{Taxes}$
- tax shield approach: $\text{OCF} = (\text{Sales} - \text{Costs}) \times (1-T) + \text{Depreciation} \times T$, where T is corporate tax rate
	- depreciation tax shield ($\text{Depreciation} \times T$): the tax saving that results from the depreciation deduction, calculated as depreciation multiplied by the corporate tax rate

# 6. Some speical cases of discounted cash flow analysis

Case study
1. investments are aimed at improving efficiency -> cutting costs
	- ex) For automation, equipment costs 80000, save 22000 per year (before taxes), has 5 year life depreicated to 0 on that period. It will be worth 20000 in 5 years. Tax rate is 34% and discount rate is 10%
		- aftertax salvage value = 20000 X (1-0.34) = 13200
		- depreciation is 80000/5= 16000 per year
		- EBIT = 22000 - 16000 = 6000
		- tax = 6000 X 0.34 = 2040
		- depreciation tax shield = 16000 X 0.34 = 5440
		- aftertax Operating cash flow  = EBIT + Depreciation - Taxes = 19960
		- NPV = 3860 > 0 at 10%  -> acceptable ![](Pasted%20image%2020231227233636.png)
2. when a firm is involved in submitting competitive bids: **Setting Bid Price**
	-  Winner is who submits the lowest bid
		- ex) The business is resale the used trucks. Distributor request bids for 5 trucks each year for next 4 years
			- We need to decide what price per truck to bid. The goal is to determine the lowest price we can profitably charge
			- Suppose truck platform are 10000 each. facilities can be leased for 24000 per year. Worker cost is about 4000 per truck
				- Total cost per year = 24000 + 5 X (10000 + 4000) = 94000
			- Needed Investments
				- New equipment is 60000 and depreciated straight line to 0 over 4 years. It will be worth about 5000 in 4 years
				- Raw materials and working capital items: 40000, get back in 4 years
				- tax rate: 39%
					- aftertax salvage value = 5000 X (1 - 0.39) = 3050
			- Then total cash flow:![](Pasted%20image%2020231227235934.png)
			- What price per truck should we bid if we require 20% return on investment?
				- $100,000 - \cfrac{43,050}{(1+0.2)^4} =79,239$
				- 4 year annutiy factor for 20% = 2.58873
				- NPV = 0 = -79,239 + OCF X 2.58873
				- OCF = 30,609 -> Operating cash flow needs to be 30,609 each year
				- Net income = 15,609
					- because, operating cash flow = net income + depreciation
						- depreciation = 60000/5= 15000
				- Sales = 134,589
					- because, Net income = (Sales - Costs - Depreciation) X (1-T)
						- Costs = 94000, T=0.39
				- Thus the sale price hase to be 134,589/5 = 26918
3. choosing between **equipment** options with **difference economic lives**
	- Goal is to choose the most cost-effective
	- ex) The business is manufacturing stamped metal subassemblies
		- Machine A costs 100 to buy and 10 per year to operate, using 2 years. Machine B costs 140 to buy and 8 per year to operate, using 3 years.
		- Which one we use at 10% discount rate?, ignoring taxes
			- Present value PV
				- Machine A's PV = $-100 + \cfrac{-10}{1.1} + \cfrac{-10}{1.1^2} = -117.36$
				-  Machine B's PV = $-140 + \cfrac{-8}{1.1} + \cfrac{-8}{1.1^2} + \cfrac{-8}{1.1^3} = -159.89$
			- EAC equivalent annual cost  (PV = EAC X Annuity factor)
				- Machine A
					- Annuity factor = $\cfrac{1- \cfrac{1}{1.1^2}}{0.1} = 1.7355$
					- -117.36 = EAC X 1.7355
					- EAC = -67.62
				- Machine B
					- Annuity factor = $\cfrac{1- \cfrac{1}{1.1^3}}{0.1} = 2.4869$
					- -159.89 = EAC X 2.4869
					- EAC = -64.29
				- Thus, B is effective than A
