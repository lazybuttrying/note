[5. Valuation of future cash flows](5.%20Valuation%20of%20future%20cash%20flows.md)

In this section, we show how financial planning models can be used to better understand how growth is achieved and how such models can be used to establish the limits on possible growth

# 1. What is financial planning

Growth, by itself, is not an appropriate goal for the financial manager

- Dimensions of financial planning
	1. Planning horizon: Long-range time period on which the financial planning process focuses, usually the next 2 to 5 years
	2. Aggregation: the process that smaller investment proposals of each firms are added up and treated as one big project
	3. Secnarios Division by assumptions about the company's product and state of the economy
		1. The worst case: pessimistic assumptions
		2. Normal case: the most likely assumptions
		3. The best case: optimistic assumptions
- What can planning Accomplish?
	- Examining interactions
		- financial plan must make explicit the ***linkages*** between investment proposals for the different operating activities of the firm and the financing choices available to firm
	- Exploring Options
		- financial plan provides the opportunity for the firm to develop, analyze, and compare many different secnarios 
	- Avoiding Surprises
		- financial plan should identify what may happen to the firm if different events take place 
	- Ensuring Feasibility and Internal Consistency
		- Verifying that the firm's goal and plans made with regard to specific areas of a firm's operations are feasible and internally consistent

# 2. Financial planning models: A first look

- Ingredients of model
	- Sales Forecast
		- It will be growth rate in sales rather than as explicit sale figure
	- Pro Forma Statements
		- It is financial reports based on hypothetical scenarios with assumptions
			- ex) forecasted balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows
	- Asset Requirements
		- Proposed capital spending in different areas must be reconciled with the overall increases conained in the long-range plan
	- Financial Requirements
		- financing arrangement such as dividend policy and debt policy
	- The Plug
		- source to deal with any shortfall (or surplus) in financing
		- ex1) Plug variable is equity: a great number of investment opportunities and limited cash flow may have to rasie new equity
		- ex2) Plug variable is dividend: few growth opportunities and ample cash flow will have a surplus and thus might pay an extra dividend
	- Economic Assumptions
		- level of interest rated 
		- firm's tax rate
- Simple financial planning model

	- If all variablew will grow by 20% based on above picture

		- Also if the plug variable is dividend,

# 3. The Percentage of Sales Approach

Financial planning method in which accounts are varied depending on a firm's predicted sales level

- The income statement
	- Dividend payout ratio  $= \cfrac{\text{Cash dividends}}{\text{Net income}}$
		- = The amount of cash paid out to shareholders divided by net income
	- Rentention ratio (plowback ratio) $= \cfrac{\text{Addition to retained earnings}}{\text{Net income}}$
		- = (1 - dividend payout ratio), because everything not paid out is retained 
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231222205106.png)
- Balance sheet
	- n/a: not applicable
		- use on long-term debt and notes payable likes bank borrowing
	- capital intensity ratio $= \cfrac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Sales}}$
		- the amount of assets needed to generate 1 dollar in sales
	- EFN extenral financing needed = Total Assets - Total liabilities and equity
		- the amount of financing the business requires form outside sources to remain profitable
		- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231222220044.png)
- A Particular Scenario ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231222220145.png)
	- Good news: 25% increase in sales
	- Bad news: will not happen unless raise 565 dollars(EFN) in new financing
	- Thus, Goal to increase sales 25% is not feasible
	- But, the firm has 3 possible source: short-term borrowing, long-term borrowing, new equity
- Alternative Scenario
	- What if the firm improve productivity? Sale increase without adding fixed asset(build plants).
	- Then EFN will be decrease because sales increased.
	- Thus the firm can decrease external funds

# 4. External financing and growth

In this section, we examine the relationship between that financial policy and the firm's ability to finance new investments and thereby grow

Growth is simply a convenient means of examining the interactions between investment and financing decisions

- Relationship between EFN and growth 
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231222225221.png)
	- Increase in Assets Required = Total Assets(600 dollars) X Projected Sales Growth
	- Whether a firm runs a cash surplus or deficit depends on growth
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231222225316.png)

- Financial Policy and Growth
	- Internal growth rate $= \cfrac{\text{ROA} \times b}{1 + \text{ROA} \times b}$
		- Maximum growth rate a firm can achieve without external financing of any kind
		- At this point, EFN is zero (required increase in asset = addition to retained earnings)
	- Sustainable growth rate $= \cfrac{\text{ROE} \times b}{1 + \text{ROE} \times b}$
		- Maximum growth rate a firm can achieve without external equity financing while maintaining a constant debt-equity ratio
			- maintain growth without increasing its financial leverage
	- Determinants of Growth
		- ROE = Profit margin X total asset turnover X equity multiplier
		- How increase sustainable growth?
			- profit margin: increase profit margin -> increase the firm's ability to generate funds internally 
			- Dividend policy: Decrease in the % of net income paid out as dividends -> increase the retention ratio, AND increases internally generated equity
			- Financial policy: Increase in the debt-equity ratio -> increase the firm's financial leverage
			- Total asset turnover: increase in the firm's total asset turnover -> the sales generated for each dollar in assets AND decrease the firm's need for new assets as sales grow
		- Therefore if a firm does not wish to sell new equity and its profit margin, dividend policy, financial policy, and total asset turnover(or capital intensity) are all fixed, then there is only one possible growth rate
