# 1. Financing life cycle of a firm: early-stage financing aid venture capital

+) OPM: other people's money

- venture capital: financing for new, often high-risk ventures
	- angels: Individual venture capitalists invest their own money
	- private equity: financing for nonpublic companies
	- Stage
		- first-stage financing: get a prototype built and a manufacturing plan completd
			- seed money (=ground floor)
		- second-stage financing: major investment needed for manufacturing, marketing, distribution
			- mezzanine level financing
- Some venture capital realities
	- VC rely on informal network(lawyers, accounts ,,,). Thus personal contacts are important in gaining access to vecture capital market (introduction market)
	- VC holds voting preferred stock, demanding 40% or more of the equity in the company
- Choosing a VC
	- Financial strength
	- Style : day-to-day operation or montly report?
		- large venture capital firm may be less flexible and more bureaucratic than a smaller “boutique” firm
	- References
		- has the vc been successful with similar firms?
		- how has the vc dealt with situations that didn’t work out
	- Contacts
		- by providing introductions to potentially important customers, suppliers, and other industry contacts.
	- Exit strategy
		- VC are generally not long-term investors

# 2. Selling securities to the public: the basic procedure

- SEC: securities and exchange commission
- registration statement: A statement filed with the SEC that discloses all material information concerning the corporation making a public offering.
	- not contain the price of the new issue. Just a price amendment is filed
- Steps of issuing securities to the public
	- obtain approval from the board of directors
		- sometimes require a vot of shareholders
	- prepare registration statement and file it with the SEC
		- exception 1: loans that mature within 9 months
		- exception 2: issues that involve less than 5 million dollars (= small-issues exemption = Regulation A)
		- exception 3:
	- Waiting period: SEC examines registration statement
		- During this time, the firm may distribute copies of a ***preliminary prospectus (=red herring)***.
			- prospectus: A legal document describing details of the issuing corporation and the proposed offering to potential investors.
			- red herring: A preliminary prospectus distributed to prospective investors in a new issue of securities. (bold red letters are printed on the cover)
	- cannot sell these securities during the waiting period 
		- but, oral offers can be made
	- On the effective date of the registration statement, 
		- a price is determined and a full fledged selling effort gets under way. 
		- a final prospectus must accompany the delivery of securities or confirmation of sale, whichever comes first

# 3. Alternative issue methods

- public issue
	- general cash offer: an issue of securities offered for sale **to the general public** on a cash basis
	- rights offering: A public issue of securities in which securities are first offered **to existing shareholders**
- private issue: register issue is sold to fewer than 35 investors
- IPO(initial public offering): A company’s first equity issue made available to the public. Also called an unseasoned new issue
	- Obviously, all initial public offerings are cash offers
	- . If the firm’s existing shareholders wanted to buy the shares, the firm wouldn’t have to sell them publicly in the first place
- SEO(seasoned equity offering): a new equity issue of securities by a company that has previously issued securities to the public
	- 4 A seasoned equity offering of common stock can be made by using a cash offer or a rights offer.

# 4. Underwriters
- basic
	- underwriters: Investment firms that act as intermediaries between a company selling securities and the investing public
		- What underwriters do
			- formulating the method used to issue the securities
			- pricing the new securities (less then the offering price)
			- selling the new securities
	- syndicate: A group of underwriters formed to **share the risk** and to **help sell an issue**.
	- gross spread (gross discount): Compensation to the underwriter, determined by the difference between the underwriter’s buying price and offering price.
		- Sometimes, on smaller deals, the underwriter will get noncash compensation in the form of warrants and stock in addition to the spread
- Choosing an underwriter
	- competitive offer: offer its securities to the highest bidding underwriter (cheaper)
	- negotitated offer: negotiate directly with an underwriter
- Types of underwriting
	- Firm Commitment Underwriting: the underwriter buys the entire issue, assuming ***full financial responsibility for any unsold shares***
		- just a purchase-resale arrangement
		- underwriter's fee is the spread
	- Best Efforts Underwriting: underwriter sells as much of the issue as possible, but can return any ***unsold shares*** to the issuer ***without financial responsibility***

- The Aftermarket (aftermath): period after a new issue is initially sold to the public
	- During this time, the members of the underwriting syndicate generally do not sell securities for less than the offering price
	- The principal underwriter is permitted to buy shares if the market price falls below the offering price. The purpose of this would be to support the market and stabilize the price against temporary downward pressure.
		- Occasionally, the price of a security falls dramatically when the underwriter ceases to stabilize the price

- Green Shoe Provision: A contract provision giving the underwriter the option to purchase additional shares from the issuer at the offering price
	- Also called the overallotment option
	- Essentially all IPOs and SEOs include this provision, but ordinary debt offerings generally do not
		-  to cover excess demand and oversubscriptions
	- usually last for about 30 days and involve no more than 15 percent of the newly issued shares
	- The Green Shoe option is a benefit to the underwriting syndicate and a cost to the issuer. If the market price of the new issue goes above the offering price within 30 days, the Green Shoe option allows the underwriters to buy shares from the issuer and immediately resell the shares to the public. (엄청 무섭네... 살자마자 죽이겠다)

- Lockup Agreements: The part of the underwriting contract that specifies how long insiders must wait after an IPO before they can sell stock
	- On the day the lockup period expires, there is the possibility that a large number of shares will hit the market on the same day and thereby depress values

# 5. IPOs and Underpricing
- Number of Offerings, Average 1st day return, and gross proceeds of IPO (1975~2000) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240104214059.png)

- The degree of underpricing varies through time and periods of severe underpricing (“hot issue” markets)  are followed by periods of little underpricing (“cold issue” markets) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240104223237.png) 
- Why does underpricing exist? ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240104224618.png)
	- the average figures we have examined tend to obscure the fact that much of the apparent underpricing is attributable to the smaller, more highly speculative issues
	- few IPO buyers will actually get the initial high average returns observed in IPOs, and many will actually lose money
		- when the price is too low, the issue is often “oversubscribed.” 
		- This means investors will not be able to buy all of the shares they want
		- and the underwriters will allocate the shares among investors
	- the underpricing is a kind of insurance for the investment banks
		- an investment bank could be sued successfully by angry customers if it consistently overpriced securities.
	- before the offer price is established, investment banks talk to big institutional investors to gauge the level of interest in the stock and to gather opinions about a suitable price

# 6. New equity sales and the Value of the firm
- This does not happen
	- new long-term financing is arranged by firms after positive NPV projects are put together. As a consequence, when the announcement of external financing is made, the firm’s market value should go up 
- This does happen
	- Stock prices tend to decline following the announcement of a new equity issue
	- although they tend to not change much following a debt announcemen
- Why?
	- Managerial information
		- Manager attempt to issue new shares of stock when the firm is overvalued
		- But shareholders are not stupid, they discount it in lower market prices at the new-issue date
	- Debt usage
		- new equity = the firm has too much debt or too little liquidity
		- Just issue debt -> let the exisitng shareholders have all the gain
	- Issue Cost

# 7. The costs of issuing securities

- The Costs of Selling Stock to the Public
	- Gross spread = direct fees paid by the issuer to the underwriting syndicate 
	- Other direct expenses: ex) filing fees, legal fees, and taxes
	- Indirect expenses: ex) cost of management time spent working on the new issue.
	- Abnormal returns: In a seasoned issue of stock, the price of stock **drops** on average by 3% upon the announcement of the issue
	- Underpricing: For IPO, losses arise from selling the stock below the true value
	- Green Shoe option: n gives the underwriters the right to buy additional shares at the offer price to cover overallotments
