# 1. Evaluating NPV estimates

- What if NPV is positive because of inaccurate estimate?
	- Like forecasting risk: the possibility that errors in projected cash flows will lead to incorrect decisions. (also called estimation risk)

- Degree of competition in the market
	- +NPV investments will be rare in competitive environment, Look at potential competition
	- Thus, +NPV is not common and the number of +NPV projects are limited for each firm

# 2. Scenario and Other What-If Analyses
We recognize the possibility of error in cash flow projection
+) base-case: inital set of projections

- Way 1: put an upper and lower bound on the various components of the project
	- In this case, Base-case NPV = -200000 + Operating cash flow  X 5 year annuity factor
		- Operating cash flow = 30000 + 40000 - 10200 = 59800 per year
		- 5 year annuity factor at 12% = 3.6048

- Way 2: Scenario analysis
	- What happens to NPV estimates when we ask what-if question?
	- useful to know what can happen and potential disaster
	- But not helpful whether or not to take the project
	- Worst-case & Best-case
		- Worst-case scenario => find minimum NPV and hope it is positive
		- Best-case scenario => find Maximum NPV
		- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231228150713.png)
		- recommend the words optimistic and pessimistic instead of best and worst
- Way 3: Senstivity analysis
	- What happens to NPV when only one variable is changed? 
	- useful for pointing out where forecasting errors will do the most damage
	- But not tell us what to do about possible errors
	- Steeper line is the greater sensitivity of the estimated NPV to chagnes 
		- More senstivie, Higher the degree of forecasting risk ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231228152202.png)
- Way 4: Simulation Analysis
	- Combination of scenario and sensitivity analysis


# 3. Break-even analysis

- Why?
	- We can calculate payback period by break-even analysis
	- A project that just breaks even on an accounting basis loses money in a financial or opportunity cost sense
		- we could have earned more by investing elsewhere (out-of-pocket sense)
		- It results in negative NPV and zero return

- Crucial questions
	- How much confidence do we have in our projections?
	- How important is the project to the future of the company?
	- How badly will the company be hurt if sales do turn out to be low? What options are available to the company in this case? 

- Fixed and Variable costs 
	- Total Cost (TC) = Variable Cost (VC) + Fixed Cost (FC)
		- VC = v X Q
		- Steep of VC is marginal cost? ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231228153043.png)
	- 
- Accounting break-even: the sales level that results in zero project net income
	- Project Net Income = (Sales - Variable costs - Fixed cost - Depreciation) X (1 - T)
	- Break even point is at $\text{Net income} = 0$
		- Quantity of output at break even point: $Q = \cfrac{FC + D}{\text{Selling price per unit (P)} - \text{Variable cost per unit (v)}}$

# 4. Operating Cash Flow, Sales Volume, and Break-Even

- Sales Volume and Operating Cash Flow
	- Operating Cash Flow $OCF = [(P-v) \times Q - FC - D] + D \ = \ (P-v) \times Q - FC$  ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231228160310.png)
- Cash flow, Accounting, and Financial Break-even points
	- $Q = \cfrac{FC + OCF}{P-v}$
	- cash break-even: the sales level that results in a 0 OCF: $Q = \cfrac{FC + 0}{P-v}$
		- A project that always just breaks even on a cash basis never pays back, has an NPV that is negative and equal to the initial outlay, and has an IRR of -100 percent.
	- financial break-even: the sales level that results in a 0 NPV
		- A project that breaks even on a financial basis has a discounted payback equal to its life, a zero NPV, and an IRR just equal to the required return.

# 5. Operating Leverage

- Operating leverage = The degree to which a firm or project relies on fixed costs
	- Lower operating leverage, Lower fixed cost
	- Higher operating leverage, heavier investment (on plant and equipment => "capital intensive"), also Greater potential danger from forecasting risk
		- Consider subcontract by increase operating leverage than to decrease it (by selling off equipment)
- Measuring Operating Leverage
	- degree of operating leverage: the percentage change in operating cash flow relative to the percentage change in quantity sold
		- Percentage change in OCF = DOL X Percentage change in Q
		- $\text{DOL} = \cfrac{(P-v) \times Q}{\text{OCF}}$
		- $\text{DOL} = 1 + \cfrac{\text{FC}}{\text{OCF}}$

# 6. Capital Rationing

- Capital rationing: Situtation that exists if a firm has positive NPV projects but cannot find the necessary financing
- Soft rationing: the situation that occurs when units in a business are allocated a certain amount of financing for captial budgeting
	- Consideration 1: whole corporation is not short of capital
	- Consideration 2: more can be raised if management so desire
	- What to do: try to get a larger allocation
		- Choosing projects with the largest benefit-cost ratio (profitability index)
- Hard Rationing:  the situation that occurs when a business cannot raise financing for a project under any circumstances
	- Case 1: the required return is so large that no project has +NPV
	- Case 2: a firm experiences financial distress (bankrupty, unable to contract agreement)
