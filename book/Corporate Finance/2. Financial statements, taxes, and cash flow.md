	- flat-rate tax: only one tax rate, same of all income levels
	- average tax rate: the ***percentage of your income*** that goes to pay taxes
	- marginal tax rate: rate of the extra tax you would pay if you earned ***one more dollar*** 
- Cash flow
	- the difference between the number of dollars that came in and the number that went out
	- Cash flow from assets = Cash flow to credictors + Cash flow to stockholders(owners) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231221211330.png)
	-  negative cash flow = firm raised more money by borrowing and selling stock ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231221210748.png),
		- Operating cash flow: cash flow results from producing and selling ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231221210442.png)
		- Capital spending: net spending on fixed asset 
			- If it is negative, then the firm sold off more assets than it purchased

		- Change in net working capital: net change in current asset relative to current liabilities ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231221210717.png)
		- Free cash flow: cash taht the firm is free to distribute to creditors and stockholders because it is not needed for working captial or fixed asset investments
