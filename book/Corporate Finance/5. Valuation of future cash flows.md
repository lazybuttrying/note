# 1. Future value and compounding

Future value (FV): The amount an investment is worth after one or more periods

- Investing for a More than one period
	- **Compounding**: the process of accumulating interest on an investment over time to earn more interest 
		- FV = $1\$ \times (1 + r)^t$
			- future value factor $= (1 + r)^t$
	- **Interest on interest**: interest earned on the reinvestment of previous interest payments
	- Compound interest: Interest earned on both the initial principal and the interest reinvestment from prior periods
	- Future value of 100 dollars at 10% ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231223000426.png)
	- Future value of 1 dollar for different periods and rates ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231223000730.png)

# 2. Present Value and Discounting

Discount: calculate the present value of some future amount
PV: The current value of future cash flows discounted at the appropriate discount rate
- The present value of 1 dollar to be received t periods into the future at a discount rate r
	- $PV = \cfrac{1\$}{(1+r)^t}$

- Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation
	- = Calculating the present value of a future cash flow to determine its value today

# 3. More on present and future values

- C = Cash amount
- r = interest rate, rate of return, or discount rate per period
- FV = $C \times (1+r)^t$
- PV = $\cfrac{C}{(1+r)^t}$
- PV is 1 divided by FV
	- Future value factor $=(1+r)^t$
	- Present value factor $= \cfrac{1}{(1+r)^t}$
	- Basic present value equation: $PV = \cfrac{FV_t}{(1+r)^t}$
