how these returns and securities look from the viewpoint of the companies that issue them
return an investor in a security receives is the cost of that security to the company that issued it

# 1. Some Preliminaries

The return an investor in a security receives = Cost of that security to the company that issued it

-  Required Return vs Cost of Capital
	- Meaning of Required return 10%
		- positive NPV no if its return exceeds 10%
		- earn 10% on the investment to compensate its investors for the use of the capital needed to finance the project
	- The cost of capital depends primarily on the use of funds, not the source
		- if the cost of capital for this project is risky, it is greater than the risk-free rate & appropriate discount rate would exceed the risk-free rate
- Financial Policy and Cost of capital
	- fixed debt-equity ratio reflects the firm's target captial structure
	- a firm's cost of capital will reflect both its cost of debt capital and its cost of equity capital

# 2. Cost of Equity
- = the return that equity investors require on their investment in the firm
- Dividend Growth Model Approach
	- Price per share of the stock $P_0 = \cfrac{D_0 \times (1+g)}{R_E - g} = \cfrac{D_1}{R_E-g}$
		- $D_1 = D_0 \times (1+g)$
		- $R_E = \cfrac{D_1}{P_0} + g$ is return that the shareholders require on the stock. 
			- it can be interpreted as the firm's cost of equity capital
		- g: growth way
			1. use historical growth rates
			2. use analysts' forecasts of future growth rates
			- ex) Avarage the 4 growth rates is (9.09+12.5+3.7+10.71)/4=9%![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240101232322.png)
	- Advantage: Simple
	- Disadvantage
		- only applicable to companies that pay dividends
		- estimated cost of equity is very sensitive to the estimated growth rate
		- not explicitly consider risk

- SML Approach
	- Using SML, expected return on the company's equity
		- $E(R_E) = R_f + \beta_E \times [E(R_M) -R_f]$
			- $R_f$: risk free rate
			- $E(R_M) - R_f$: market risk premium
			- $\beta$: systematic risk of the asset relative to average
				- $B_E$: estimated beta
		- $R_E = R_f + \beta_E \times (R_M-R_f)$
	- Advantage
		- explicitly adjusts for risk
		- applicable to companies onther than just those with steady dividend growth
	- Disadvantage
		- It requires 2 things be estimated: market risk premium & beta coefficient
			- if estimates are poor, resulting cost of equity will be inaccurate
		- rely on the past to predict the future

# 3. Cost of Debt and Preferred stock

- Cost of debts $R_D$: 
	- = the return that lenders requires on the firm's debt
	- = the return that firm's creditors demand on new borrowing
	- = the interest rate the firm must pay on new borrowing 
		- Yield to maturity on firm's bonds is the market-required rate on the firm's debt
		- so no need to estimate a beta for debt because we can directly observe the rate
- Cost of Preferred Stock $R_P = \cfrac{D}{P_0}$
	- $D$ is fixed dividend, $P_0$ is the current price per share of the preferred stock
	- $R_P$ = dividend yeild on the preferred stock

# 4. Weighted average cost of capital

! we are using market values of the debt and equity

- The capital structure weights
	- $V=E+D$
		- V: value, E: equity, D:debt
	- Capital structure weights: $100\%=E/V+D/V$
- Taxes and the weighted average cost of capital
	- WACC: weighted average cost of capital (cost of equity & aftertax cost of debt)
		- $\text{WACC} = (E/V) \times R_E + (D/V) \times R_D \times (1-T_C)$
			- $T_C$: corporate tax rate, $R_D \times (1-T_C)$: aftertax rate
		- = overall return the firm must earn on its existing assets to maintain the value of its stock
		- = required return on any investments by the firm that have essentially the same risks as existing operations
		-  develop WACC for using as discount rate
	- WACC with preferred stock
		- $\text{WACC} = (E/V) \times R_E + (P/V) \times R_P + (D/V) \times R_D \times (1-T_C)$
			- $R_P$: the cost of preferred stock
- Calculate WACC
	- estimate the cost of equity $R_E$ 
		- using CAPM: $R_f + \beta_E(E(R_M)-R_f)$
			- when it looks like a relatively low return for shareholders to require based on our previous discussion of historical returns
		- using dividend discount model: $\cfrac{D_0 \times (1+g)}{R_E - g}$
		- using average the 2 estimates
	- estimate the cost of debt
		- using book value can lead to overstating trouble, particularly if equity book values are used ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240102001411.png)

- Performance Evaluation
	- EVA: economic value added method
		- evaluating corporate performance
	- ex) Suppose we have $100 million in capital (debt and equity) tied up in our firm, and our overall WACC is 12 percent. If we multiply these together, we get $12 million. 
		- if our cash flow from assets is less than this, we are destroying value
		- if cash flow from assets exceeds $12 million, we are creating value

# 5. Divisonal and project costs of capital

- Riskier division of the cost of capital -> Greater returns
- SML and WACC
	- if a firm uses its WACC to make accept-reject decisions for all types of projects, it will have a tendency towards incorrectly accepting risky projects and incorrectly rejecting less risky projects.![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240102002438.png)


- Pure play approach
	- = use of WACC that is unique to a particular project, based on companies in similar lines of business
- Subjective Approach
	- With the subjective approach, the firmâ€™s WACC may change through time as economic conditions change. As this happens, the discount rates for the different types of projects will also change. ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240102213339.png)
	- Discount rate (used to value the project) is determined by adding (for high risk) or subtracting (for low risk) an adjustment factor to or from the firm's WACC ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020240102213645.png)

# 6. Flotation costs and the weighted average cost of capial

flotation cost: If a company accepts a new project, it may be required to issue, or float, new bonds and stocks (firm will incure some cost)
- $f_E$: equity flotation cost
- $f_D$: debt flotation cost
- $f_A$: weighted average flotation cost

So how to include flotation cost in a project analysis?

- Basic Approach
	- Firm needs to sell enough equity to raise money (100 million dollar) after covering the flotation cost (10% of the amount issued)
		- 100 million = (1-0.10) X Amount raised
	- ex) A firms' "target" capital structure is 60% equity, 40% debt. The flotation costs associated with equity are 10%
		- $f_A = (E/V) \times f_E + (D/V) f_D$
		- 60% X .10 + 40% X .05 = 8%
			- For every dollar in outside financing needed for new projects, the firm must actually raise $\cfrac{1}{1-.08}=108.7$ million
- Flotation costs and NPV
	- Ex) A firm's target debt-equity ratio 100%, building a new 500,000 dollars plant expected to generate aftertax cash flows of 73,150 per year forever. Tax rate 34%
		- Financing Option 1) 500,000 dollars new issue of common stock
			- Issuance cost of it is 10% of the amount raised
			- Required return on new equity is 20%
		- Financing Option 2) 500,000 dollars issue of 30-years bonds
			- Issuance cost of it is 2% of the proceeds
			- Company can raise new debt at 10%
		- WACC = .50 X 20% + .50 X 10% X (1 - .34) = 13.3%
		- PV = 73,150/0.133 = 550,000
		- NPV = 550,000 - 500,000 = 50,000
		- $f_A = (E/V) \times 10\% + (D/V) \times 2\% = 6\%$
