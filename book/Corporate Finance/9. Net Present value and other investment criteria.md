# 1. Net present value

NPV(net present value) = market value - cost = value added by management
- NPV rule (accept-reject decision): if NPV > 0, do invest, but be careful the risk 
- by discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227133433.png)
	- Present value = $6\$ \times \cfrac{1-\cfrac{1}{(1+0.15)^8}}{0.15} + \cfrac{20\$}{(1+0.15)^8}$ where discount rate 15%
	- NPV = - initial cost + present value

# 2. Payback rule

![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227135551.png)
- payback = length of time it takes recover our initial investment
	- considered break-even measure
- payback rule: if its calculated payback period is less than some prespecified number of years, do invest
	- flaw 1) not involve discounting = ignoring time value -> led to invest (like short)
	- flaw 2) ignoring cash flows beyond the cut off -> led to reject long-term invest (like long)
- Why use payback rule?
	- primary reason: cost of analysis > possible loss from a mistake => +NPV
	- positive feature for small business: free up cash more quickly
		- it is biased towards short-term projects (adjust uncertainty of later cash flows)
		- it is biased towards liquidity

# 3. Discounted payback

![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227142813.png)

- discounted payback preiod: length of time required for an investment's discounted cash flows to equal its initial cost
- discounted payback rule: if discounted payback < some presepcified number of years, do invest
	-  we get our money back in 4 years, not 3 years ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227135943.png)
	- At the cross point of 2 lines, the value of project's cash flows catches up (NPV=0) and passes the original investment in 4 years. But, it just results of a lot of investment![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227140333.png) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227142627.png)


# 4. AAR: The average accounting return

![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227143224.png)

- AAR = $\cfrac{\text{Average net income}}{\text{Average book value}}$
	- it is closely related to ROA (Return on assets) because AAR sometimes computed by first calculating the ROA for each year nad then averaging the results 
- AAR rule: if AAR > target average accounting return, do invest

# 5. IRR: Internal Rate of Return
- IRR: the discount rate that makes NPV of an investment zero
	- NPV = 0 = - initial cost + present value 
		- present value = $\cfrac{\text{Face value}}{(1+R)}$, where R is discounted rate
	- Actually R is IRR when NPV = 0, thus IRR is required return when NPV=0
	- ex) if invest with -100 dollar and cash flow 60 dollars per year for 2 years,
		- NPV = 0 = $-100\$ + \cfrac{60}{1+\text{IRR}}+ \cfrac{60}{(1+\text{IRR})^2}$
- IRR rule: if IRR > required return, do invest
- Net present value profile: graphical representation of the relationship between an investment's NPVs and various discount rates ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227144852.png)
- Problems with IRR ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227151835.png)
	- nonconventional cash flows: on multiple rates of return problem, the NPV profile is ... 
		- IRR can be multiple not only one! ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227145120.png)
	- mutually exclusive investments decision: a situation in which taking one investment prevents the taking of another 
		- IRR of A is higher than B -> A is better because of its higher return
		- But, it's not always correct -> NPV and IRR rankings conflict for some discount rates ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227150759.png)
		- Crossover point: the rate statisfied $NPA_A = NPA_B$ , $NPA(A-B)= 0$ ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231227151452.png)

# 6. Profitability index (PI)

PI = present value of an investment's future cash flows divided by its initial cost
- also called benefit-cost ratio
- means the value created per dollar invested

if NPV is positive, PI > 1, but NPV is negative, PI < 1
- ex) PI = 1.1 means per dollar invested, 1.10 dollar in value or 0.10 dollar in NPV results
