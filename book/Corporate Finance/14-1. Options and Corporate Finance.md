options: a contract that gives its owner the right to buy or sell some asset at a fixed price on or before a given date.


# 1. Options: The Basics
- Vocabulary
	- Exercising the option: Act of buying or selling the underlying asset via the option contract
		- Call option: the right to buy an asset at a fixed price during a particular period of time
		- Put option: the right to sell an asset at a fixed price during a particular period of time
	- Strike price (exercise price): Fixed price specificed in the option contract at which the holder can buy or sell the underlying asset 
	- Expiration date: The last day on which option may be exercised
	- American & European options:
		- American option: excercised any time up to and including the expiration date
		- European option: exercised only on the expiration date

- ex) Last means price, $a^b$ means a.b dollars ![](Pasted%20image%2020231230161235.png)

- Option payoffs
	- Out of money: stock price < exercise price
		- Love Put option
	- In the money: stock price > exercise price
		- Love Call option

# 2. Fundamentals of option valuation

$S_1$ = Stock price at expiration (in one period) 
$S_0$ = Stock price today 
$C_1$ = Value of the call option on the expiration date (in one period) 
$C_0$ = Value of the call option today 
$E$ = Exercise price on the optio

- Value of Call option
	- if the stock price (S1) ends up below the exercise price (E) on the expiration date, then the call option (C1) is worth zero
		- $C_1$ = 0 if $S_1 \leq E$ : The option is out of money when it expires
	
	- if the option finishes in the money, then $S_1 \geq E$, and the value of the option at expiration is equal to the difference
		- $C_1 = S_1 - E$, if $S_1 > E$
	- Value of a call option ***at*** expiration for different stock price![](Pasted%20image%2020231230162739.png)
	- Value of a call option ***before*** expiration for different stock prices 
		- Lower bound = intrinsic value: what the option would be worth if it were about to expire
			- $C_0 \geq S_0 -E$ for preventing arbitrage

- Total cost of acquiring stock by call option = Price of Call Option + Excercise price of call option
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020231230163716.png)
	- The value of call option in this case,
		- $S_0 = C_0 + \cfrac{E}{(1+R_f)^t}$
		- $C_0 = S_0 - \cfrac{E}{(1+R_f)^t}$: 
			- Call option value = Stock value - Present value of exercise price
- 5 Factors determining option values
	- Stock price $S_0$: Higher stock price, More the call is worth
	- Exercise price $E$: Higher exercise price, Less the call is worth
	- Time to expriation $t$: Longer time to expriation, More the option is worth
	- Risk free rate $R_f$: Higher risk free rate, the more call is worth
		- The excercise price is a cash flow, a liability. So the current value of that liability goes down as the discount rate goes up
	- More volatile in stock's future price (return) $\sigma^2$: Greater that variance, More option is worth 
		- the future price range [110~130] becomes bigger [105~135]
		- High risk, High return

# 3. Valuing a call option

- 현재 주식 가격이  35인데 나중에 25로 내려갈 수도, 50으로 올라갈 수도 있다. 
	- 만약 무위험이자율이 10%라면, 가격 하락 시 비용은 25/1.1 =22.73이다
	- 가격 상승 시, (상승된 주식 가격)/(옵션행사가격) 개수만큼 사뒀다면 장땡
- Investing the present value of lower stock price in a riskless asset and buying 2 call options = duplicates owning the stock
	- ex) $S_0 =100\$, E=11\$, R_f=20\%$
		- When the stock is worth 110 dollars, we have 110 dollars from (our risk-free investment)
		- When the stock is worth 130 dollars, we have 110 dollars from (our risk-free investment + 2 call options worth 10 dollars each)
		- $S_0 = 2 \times C_0 + \cfrac{E}{1+R_f}$ => Each call option is worth $C_0=4.17\$$
	- ex) $S_0 = 100\$$, $S_1 = 80 \text{or}  120\$$, $E = 90\$$, $R_f = 0.05$
		- The option is worth 0 when $S_1 = 80\$ < E$
		- The option is worth $120-90=30$ when $S_1 = 120\$ > E$
		- Thus, we will invest $80\$$ in risk-free aset and buy some call options
			- if $S_1=120\$$, left money is $40\$$ and each option is worth $30\$$
			- So we need $40/30$ options to match the payoff on the stock
				- $S_0 = (4/3) \times C_0 + \cfrac{E}{1+R_f}$
				- $C_0=17.86\$$ on each call option
	- Therefore $\Delta S / \Delta C = 1$ when option is in the money. Otherwise $\Delta S / \Delta C > 1$ so more than 1 call option is needed


# 4. (Employee) stock options (ESO)

- ESO
	- = An option granted to an employee by a company giving the employee the right to buy shares of stock in the company at a fixed price for a fixed time
	- always "at the money" when they issued
		- at the time, intrinsic value is zero

- ESO features
	- has 10-year life (much longer than most ordinary options)
	- Not be sold
		- Vesting preiod: for up 3 years, ESO cannot be exercised and must be forfeited if an employee leaves the company
		- Vest = they can be exercised
- Reason to use
	- aligining shareholder and management interest
		- providing incentives for employees to focus on corporate goals
	- ESO has no immediate, upfront, out-of-pocket cost to the corporation. 
		- simply a substitute for ordinary wages
- ESO Repricing
	- Underwater: the granted ESO option's stock falls significantly
	- Restruck (Reprice): decide to lower strike price on underwater options
	- Sadly, in that case employee may leave the company.
	- But a lowered strike price is a reward for failing
