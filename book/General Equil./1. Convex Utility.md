# Convexity
1. Why does utility/preference form Convexity?
- Convexity: $\alpha f( x_1)+ (1-\alpha )f(x_2) \geq f(\alpha x_1+ (1-\alpha)x_2)$
- Explanation: Whenever you like two bundles $x$ and $y$, then you like (weakly) any combination of them
  - $x \succeq z$ and $y \succeq z \implies \alpha x + (1-\alpha)y \succeq z, \quad \text{for all } \alpha \in [0,1]$
  - == **upper contour sets** of preferences are convex sets

2. Economic intuition
- Convexity captures the **“preference for diversification / variety”**
  - ex) People prefer some combination (a fruit basket), rather than only 100 apples or only 100 bananas,
- Without convexity, preferences could be “all-or-nothing” (you like only corner solutions), which makes optimization unstable.
  - Under non-convex preference $\implies$ Unstable Optimization
  - multiple, discontinuous, or corner solutions
- Convexity -> Unique Solution



# Constraits of Preference
### 1. Rationality
- Completeness = All bundles should be ***comparable***
- Transitivity = Ensure ***consistency of choices***
  - no cycles, prevents 'money pump'
  - $x \succeq x$:reflexity ~ baseline consistency

### 2. Mathematical well-behavior
- Continuity
  - Small changes in a bundle don't cause sudden jumps in preference
  - continuous utility function ensure 'preference' and 'optimized solution'
- Convexity = Consumers like variety or diversification
  - via separating hyperplane theorem

### 3. Economic Meaning
- Monotonicity = More is always better
- Local Non-Satiation = can always improve by getting more of sth
  - for existence of Walrasian Equilibrium

### 4. Addional
- Reflexivity
- Strong Convexity
- Independece Axiom
- Archimedean propert
- IIA
