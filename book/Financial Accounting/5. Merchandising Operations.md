### Flow of Cost
1. Perpectual inventory system: 
	1. !! **Physical Count** of its goods on hand !!
	2. detailed records of the cost of **each inventory purchase and sale**
	3. the inventory should be **on hand** for every item
	4. determine the cost of goods sold **each tiem a sale occurs**
3. Periodic inventory system
	1. determine the cost of **goods sold only at the end of the accounting period**

# 2. [Buyer] Recording *Purchases* of Merchandise

## 1. Freight Cost 

FOB(free on board): seller places the goods free on board ...
		1. FOB Shipping Point: to just the carrier
			1. The cost is regarded to buyer as invectory cost (debit)
		2. FOB Destination: to the buyer's place of buisness
			1. The cost is regarded to seller as operating expense

## 2. Purchase Returns and Allowances 
### -> *No Effect on Cash Flows*

The state of goods is bad, thus ... 
	1. Purchase Return: = purchaser wants to **refund** & returns the goods
	2. Purchase Allowance: = purchase choose to **keep** the goods with allowance(deduction) from seller

## 3. Purchase Discounts

> If the buyer had no discount,  the buyer has reduced its cost.
> Therefore inventory asset is decreased.
> In this case, discount may be viewd as **paying interest** for use of money

1. Credit terms: the amount of the cash discount and time period 
	1. "net" = **remaining** amount **due** after subtracting anything
	2. ex) "2/10, n/30" = "two-ten, net thirty"
		1.  2% cash discount on the invoice price
			1. less ("net of") any returns or allowances 
			2. if payment is made within 10 days of teh invoice date (**discounted period**)
	3. ex) "1/10 EOM" (End of Month)
		1. 1% discount if the invoice is paid within the first 10 days of the next month
	4. ex) only net prices "n/30", "n/60", "n/10 EOM"
		1. No discount, thus set maximum time period due to pay
		2. must pay in 30 days, 60 days, or within first 10 days of the next month
