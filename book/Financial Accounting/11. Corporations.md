# 2. Accounting for Share Transactions

- Share capital
	- consist of preference and ordinary shares
- Share premium
	- includes the excess of amounts paid over PAR or stated value and share premium from treasury shares
## 2-1. Accounting for Ordinary Share Issues

> PAR value of the shares is never a factor in determining the cost of the assets received

1. Issuing PAR value ordinary shares for cash
	1. When the company records issuance of ordinary shares for cash, it credits the par value of the shares to Share Capital
	2. When a corporation issues shares for less than par value, it debits the account Share Premium if a credit balance exists in this account 
2. Issuing No-PAR ordinary shares for cash
	1. The corporation credits the stated value to Share Capital
	2. When the selling price of no-par shares exceeds stated value, the corporation credits the excess th Share Premium
3. Issuing ordinary shares for services or non-cash assets
	1. services: compensations to attorneys or consultants
	2. non-cash assets: land, buildings, and equipment
	3. Cost in a non-cash transaction is cash equivaleunt price (cost is fair value)
	4. EX) attorneys have helped a company. They have billed $5000\$$ for their services. They agree to accept 4000 shares for $1\$$ par value ordinary shares ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231217213452.png)

## 2-2. Accounting for Treasury Shares

> If the selling price of the treasury shares >= their cost, Then the company records the sale of the shares by a debit to a Cash and a credit to Treasury Shares
> If the selling price of the treasury shares < their cost, Then the company debits to Share Premium-Treasury the excess of cost over selling price 
> 
> Thus, the sale of treasury shares increases both total assets and total equity

![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231217215253.png)

- Treasury shares: a corporation's own shares that it has issued and subsequently reacquired from shareholders but not retired.
	- Do not have dividend rights or voting rights
- Reason to acquire treasury shares

	3. To have additional shares available for use in the acquisition of other companies
	4. To reduce the number of shares outstanding and thereby increase earnings per share
	5. For management to eliminate hostile shareholders by buying shares

	2. Adequate cash
	3. A declaration of dividends by board of directors
- Entries for cash dividends
		![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020231218142531.png)
 - Allocating cash dividends between preference and ordinary shares
	 - In 2017, Preferecne shares are total 1000 shares (8%, $100\$$), ordinary  shares are 50,000 shares ($10\$$)
		 - Dividend per share for preference share: $8\$$ <=  $8\% \times 100\$$
		 - Required annual dividend for preference share: $8000\$$ <=  $1000 \times 8\$$
		- If the directors declare $6000\$$ cash dividend, 
			- Arrears on preference shares:  $2000\$$ <=  $1000 \times (8\$-6\$)$
	- In 2018, if the directors declare $5000\$$ cash dividend, the allocation of the dividend as follows
