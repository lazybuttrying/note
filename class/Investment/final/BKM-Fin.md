![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192201.png)
### 11)  
The answer is a. 
Weak form EMH asserts that stock prices already reflect market trading data. It implies that trend analysis is fruitless

![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192232.png)
### 15)
Yes.
Private information triggers the price rising. It's impossible in EMH.

![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192252.png)
### 25)
1. Do event studies on past announcement. If security prices reflect all currently available information, then price changes must reflect new information. Therefore, it seems that one should be able to measure the importance of an event of interest by examining price changes during the peroid in which the event occurs.
2. Determine abnormal return from market model including industry.
	1. $R_{Ford}= \alpha + \beta_M R_M+ \beta_{IND} R_{IND} + e$
	2. $e = R_{Ford} - (\alpha + \beta_M R_M +\beta_{IND} R_{IND})$
### 26)
Yes.
Investor was dissapointed that increased annual earning is lower than expectation.
### 27)
Thinly traded stock has a scarce market trading data. CAPM explains market risk premiums. Thus, positive CAPM alpha implies the higher alphas in market risk and does not violates market efficiency.

### 28)
Insider sells before the bad news.
Insider purchases after the bad news with expectation of good news. 



![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192348.png)
### 29)

(a) No. Timing to determine the cycle phase is difficult to everyone. Changing risk premiums is not related to market efficiency

(b) Stock price decreases in recession, becuase risk tolerance might be lower and investors could sell many stocks. In contrast, stock price increases in booming, because risk tolerance might be higher and investors could buy many stocks.  This price impact occurs in short period which means 'overreact.'


![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192439.png)
### CFA 3)
The answer is c.
Random walk implies unpredictable change on stock price.

![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192500.png)
### CFA 7)

(a)
Growth stocks' growth rates can be easily overestimated by investors. 
By representativeness heuristic, investors tend to overweight recent events. It cause inevitable slowdown in future.
- Growth stock: revert to lower mean returns
- Value stocks: revert to higher mean returns

(b) 
Current stock price has to reflect all information in efficiency.
In this situation, growth stocks and value stocks provide the same risk-adjusted expected return

# CH 12) Behavioral Finance

Bias in Information Processing
- Forecasting Errors: much weight to recent experience
- Overconfidence: overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts
- Conservatism: too slow in updating their beliefs in response to new evidence -> momentum
- Sample size neglect and Representativeness: do not take into account the size of a sample, acting as if a small sample is just as representative of a population as a large one.


![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192553.png)
### 3)
Overconfidence.
Investors overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts and they tend to overestimate their abilities.


![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192606.png)
### 5)
New information will be adjusted to price quickly in efficient market. Therefore only indexing is the best well-adjusted price compared to the other.
Mispricing from bias in information processing cause lower returns in behavioral finance. Therefore indexing is the best because bias in information processing cannot exist in indexing.

a -> iv
b -> iii
c -> v
d -> i
e -> ii


![](resource/Pasted image 20240508192725.png)
### 12)
Because irractional investors makes mispricing continuously. Therefore we need efficient allocation to hedge the risk of irrational investors.

### CFA 1)

Yield curve reflects investor ==expectations== about future interest rates. 
According to this theory, long-term interest rates are an average of current and expected future short-term interest rates. (1) If investors expect future s**hort-term rates to be higher than current short rates**, the yield curve will slope **upwards**. Conversely, (2) if they expect future short-term rates to fall, the yield curve will slope downwards.

The ==liquidity preference hypothesis== suggests that investors demand a premium for holding longer-term bonds rather than rolling over short-term bonds.
As a result, (1) **long-term interest rates** will typically be **higher than short-term** rates to compensate for this additional risk, resulting in an **upward**-sloping yield curve. In contrast, (2) A **downward** slope under this hypothesis would indicate a strong expectation of **falling future interest rates than current short rate,** overshadowing the usual liquidity premium

	- Price of coupon bond:  774.84
		- =0.06*(1-(1+0.08)^(-30))/0.08 + 1000/((1+0.08)^30)
- YTM 9%

	- Price of coupon bond:  691.79
- YTM 7%
	- Price of zero coupon bond: 422.04
	- Price of coupon bond:  875.91

(a) 
- Acutal percentage capital loss
	- Zero coupon bond: $\cfrac{333.28-374.84}{374.84}=-0.1109$,  loss 11.09%
	- Coupon bond: $\cfrac{691.79-774.84}{774.84}=-0.1072$, loss 10.72%
- By the duration-with-convexity rule
	- Zero coupon bond: $(-11.81\times 0.01)+(\frac{1}{2}\times150.3\times0.01^2)=-0.1106$
		- loss 11.06%
	- Coupon bond:  $(-11.79\times 0.01)+(\frac{1}{2}\times231.2\times0.01^2)=-0.1063$
		- loss 10.63%

(b)
- Acutal percentage capital loss
	- Zero coupon bond: $\cfrac{422.04-374.84}{374.84}=0.1259$,  Gain 12.59%
	- Coupon bond: $\cfrac{875.91-774.84}{774.84}=0.1304$, Gain 13.04%
- By the duration-with-convexity rule
	- Zero coupon bond: $(-11.81\times (-0.01))+(\frac{1}{2}\times150.3\times0.01^2)=0.1256$
		- Gain 12.56%
	- Coupon bond:  $(-11.79\times (-0.01))+(\frac{1}{2}\times231.2\times0.01^2)=0.1295$
		- Gain 12.95%

(c)
- The coupon bond outperforms zero coupon bond due to its higher convexity. It's not related to the change of rate.

(d)
- No one wants to buy lower convexity bond if it underperforms.
	- Lower convexity -> price fall -> YTM increase (higher yield)
- If rates change slightly, higher yield & lower convexity bond will be preferred. But changing large amount, lower yield & higher convexity bond will be preferred.

i. Modified duration will increase due to decreasing coupon rates
ii. Modified duration will decrease due to decreasing maturity duration

(d)
- $\cfrac{\Delta P}{P} = (-D^* \times \Delta y) + \frac{1}{2} \times Convexity \times (\Delta y)^2$

ii. Stock B for hedge to market portfolio
iii. Stock B due to higher treynor measure

- Intercept means excess return. 
- Negative excess return means poor selection.

### CFA 6)

(a)
- Treynor: 
	- S&P 500: $\cfrac{0.08-0.02}{1}=0.06$
	- X: $\cfrac{0.06-0.02}{0.6}=0.0667$
- Sharpe:
	- S&P 500: $\cfrac{0.08-0.02}{0.13}=0.4615$
	- X: $\cfrac{0.06-0.02}{0.18}=0.2222$
- X outperforms market on Treynor measure, but underperforms on Sharpe measure.

(b)
- X has lower beta than market. It means lower systematic risk.
- But X has higher standard deviation of return. It means higher unsystematic risk. (volatility)
- Thus, X outperforms market on Treynor measure, but underperforms on Sharpe measure.
