- Proof of penalty of curtailing dividend 
	- Asymmetric market Reaction 
	- Omission (penalty)  > Initiation (benefit) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020241203001535.png)

- Earning vs Dividend
	- earning 발표가 dividend 전/후 관계없이 주가가 반응
	- 즉, Earning에 포함되지 않은 정보가 dividend에 포함됨 
	- ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020241203001751.png)


- 같은 cost지만 배당은 배당락으로 인해 firm value가 감소하는데 반해, 자사주 매입 후 소각은 PER 상승 (per share 감소 덕분)에 주가가 오르는 효과까지 있음.

# 1. Methods of Cash Dividends
1. Types of Dividends
	1. Cash dividend
	2. Stock dividend
	3. Dividend in kind
2. Procedure for Cash Dividend Payment ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020241202143050.png)
	1. Declaration Date: The Board of Directors declares a payment of dividends. 
	2. Cum-Dividend Date: The last day that the buyer of a stock is entitled to the dividend. 
	3. Ex-Dividend Date: The first day that the seller of a stock is entitled to the dividend. 
	4. Record Date: The corporation prepares a list of all individuals believed to be stockholders as of 6 November.
3. Price behavior around Ex-dividend Date ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020241202143209.png)

- In an ideal situation, dividend policy does not matter to firm value (homemade dividends)

4. Real Word Factors
	1. Reasons for low dividend
		1. Personal Taxes
		2. High Issuing Costs
	2. Reasons for high dividend
		1. Information Asymmetry: Dividends as a signal
			1. + dividend보다 curtail 시 negative가 너무 커
			2. 그래서 함부로 + dividend 하지 않음. 그러면 앞으로 ongoing good firm이라고 알리게 되는 거라
			3. 즉, dividend init은 continuous earning이 예상될 때만 할 수 있는 거다.
			4. 그래서, 투자자는 dividend init 시 지속될 거라 보기에 dividend 삭감 시 penalty를 부여함
		2. Lower Agency Costs
			1. monitoring by capital market
				1. cash holding하기 보단 배당으로 나한테 주는 게 나을 거라고 투자자가 판단함
			2. reduce free cash flow -> 
		3. Bird-in-the-hand: Theory or Fallacy?
			1. Uncertainty resolution
			2. A firm’s overall cash flows are not necessarily affected by dividend policy—as long as capital spending and borrowing are not changes
		4. Desire for current income
		5. Clientele Effect
			1. try to attract certain types of investors (연기금이 오면 내 회사가 괜찮다고 보여지니깐)

# 2. Tax & Dividend

1. Effects of 2003 dividend tax cut 
	1. increases dividend-initiation
	2. 영향 받는 owner가 누구인지에 따라 달라진다.
		1. 큰 기관투자자가 오면 dividend init 증가

# 3. Signaling & Dividend

1. Outline
	1. Does a firm signal its future earnings through dividend? 
	2. Can we tell the effects of earnings announcement and dividend announcements? 
		1. In practice, many firms announce quarterly earnings and dividend simultaneously. 
		2. Distinguish dividend declaration vs. earnings announcement


1. Why maintain the level of dividend
	1. Asymmetric market reaction
	2. dividend omission -> lower equity price

2. Cash flow permanence 
	1. Cash flow from operation = Operating income before depreciation - interest taxes - change in working capital
	2. ==***Dividends*** depend on the ***permanent cash flow*** while share ***repurchases*** depend on ***transient shocks***.==
	3. After a cash flow shock, payout choice can signal the permanence of cash flows.
	4. Controlling for payout size and the market's expectation about the permanence of the cash-flow shock, the stock price reaction to dividend increases is more positive than the reaction to repurchase

4. Managers' view 
	1. dividends are sticky
		1. tided to long-term sustainable earnings
			1. mature firms prefer than young firms
		2. smoothed from year to year
		3. Managers want a slow adjustment process when dividend rate is far from target ratio
	2. That's why managers' favor repurchases
		1. more flexible
		2. They believe that institutional investors are indifferent between dividends and repurchases (while individual investors like dividends)
	3. Brava et al concluded that management views do not support agency, signaling, clientele hypotheses


# 4. Share Repurchase & Corporate Governance Related Issues

- Stock Returns of buy back firms
	- Value Stocks shows positive BHAR, supporting undervaluation
	- Glamour stocks do not show positive return


- Stock Repurchases = Good news
	- equity-linked compensation of senior management of buyback firms
	- exceed that of matching firms
- Repeated Repurchases != Good
	- ***Transient institutional investors*** equity holdings of buyback firms are ***smaller*** than their holdings of matching firms following buyback announcements by repeat repurchases


- Methods of Share Repurchase
	- Open-market Repurchase
	- Targeted Repurchase
		- Greenmail
		- Gadflies = 주주제안에 적극적인 개인투자자
	- Tender offers
		- if offer price is set wrong, some stockholders lose


- Disappearing Cash Dividends
	- Growing up of Young firm
	- Share repurchase better serves managerial incentives


- Managers of a firm with large stock options might choose not cash dividends but share repurchase (Fenn & Liang 1997) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020241202160223.png)
- Managers facing takeover threats use share repurchases to defer M&A (Bagwell, 1991) ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020241202160502.png)
	- Stock repurchase generates a negative return when firm is under a takeover threat (Denis, 1990)

- If the purpose of share repurchase is to secure CS(controlling shareholder)' control position, there will be negative returns to announcements
	- CS/Insider with weak control have an entrenchment incentive
		- Share repurchase affects ownership 
		- 경영권 방어용 repurchase는 decreasing firm value
		- M&A 위협에 시장이 negative reaction이면 premium 또한 낮아져서 share repurchase 효과가 감소되기 때문 ![](resource/Pasted%20image%2020241202160831.png)
	- Firms with higher control rights are less likely to adopt share repurchase
		- if they adopt, the magnitude is small 
		- the market responds positively


# 5. Summary

- In a perfect world,
	- dividend policy does not matter
	- dividend and share repurchase will be indifferent
- Dividend policy matters due to taxes, clients, transactions, etc.
- Market reaction is positive to dividend increase or initiation, suggesting that dividends contain information on future earnings
- Managerial incentive can affect share repurchases
