Insurance coverage. Traditional bank savings accounts and CDs are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Money market funds aren't insured by the FDIC. Instead, they may be eligible for $500,000 coverage under SIPC when held in a brokerage account.

Accessibility. Because they're mutual funds, money market fund sales are processed like sales of other mutual fundsâ€”the trade is processed at the close of business following your trade request, and the money then takes 2 business days to transfer to your bank account. Bottom line, you'll need to allow time for money movement.
