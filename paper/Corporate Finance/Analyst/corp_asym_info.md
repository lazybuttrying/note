| Policy area                        | Objective                                       | Natural‐experiment context                                                                             | Typical method                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Investment** (Capital Budgeting) | Maximize equity value                           | Deregulation of industry entry (e.g. airline deregulation in 1978) → firms’ CapEx responses            | DiD on treated vs. control routes                |
| **Financing** (Capital Structure)  | Prevent default risk as minimizing capital cost | Change in banking‐regulation zones (e.g. Basel acceding countries vs. non‐Basel) → leverage adjustment | Regression discontinuity around threshold        |
| **Payout**                         | shareholder's profit or re-investment           | Tax‐law change on dividend taxation across states or countries → shift between dividends vs. buybacks  | Panel regressions with firm & year fixed effects |
| **Cash holdings**                  | Liquidity Management                            | Unexpected credit‐market freeze (e.g. Lehman collapse) → firms’ precautionary cash demand              | Event‐study around shock date                    |

# **Asymmetric information** 
occurs when, in a transaction or relationship, one party possesses more or better information than the other. This imbalance can lead to two key problems:

1. **Adverse selection**
    - **Before** a transaction occurs, the less‑informed party may make decisions that expose them to higher risk.
    - _Example:_ In insurance markets, individuals know their own health risks better than insurers. Those with poorer health are more likely to buy rich coverage, driving up premiums for everyone.
2. **Moral hazard**
    - **After** a transaction or contract is in place, the party with more information can take actions that the other cannot fully observe or control.
    - _Example:_ A firm borrows money and then undertakes riskier projects than the lender anticipated, because the lender cannot perfectly monitor its day‑to‑day decisions.

### Why it matters in corporate finance
if the firm might withhold bad news or has opaque reporting, (=asymmetrically distributed)
- **Cost of capital:** Lenders and investors demand higher returns
- **Liquidity:** Stocks of the firm tend to trade less actively (wider bid–ask spreads)
- **Market efficiency:** Mispricing and volatility rise.
### How firms mitigate asymmetric information
1. **Voluntary disclosure & guidance**
    - Firms issue earnings forecasts, investor presentations, and detailed MD&A sections to signal quality.     
2. **Signaling**
    - High‑quality firms pay higher dividends or pursue equity issues only when insider managers purchase shares, conveying confidence.
	    - **Costly Signals Are Credible**: Only high‐quality firms **can afford the cost** of the signal, so investors trust it.
	    - **Separating Equilibrium**: In a market with both high‐ and low‐quality firms, a costly action (the signal) causes only high‐quality firms to engage, allowing investors to “separate” types.
3. **Screening**
    - Investors demand covenants, collateral, or staged financing to reduce the risk that borrowers will act opportunistically.
	    - **Covenants**
		    - **Financial covenants:** e.g. maintaining a debt‐to‐equity ratio or interest‐coverage ratio below a specified threshold
            - **Behavioral covenants:** e.g. prohibitions on additional borrowing, asset sales, or requiring prior approval for major investments
            - **Purpose:** Prevent borrowers from taking excessive risks or reallocating assets in ways that harm creditors’ interests.
		- **Collateral**
		    - **Pledged assets:** e.g. real estate, machinery, inventory offered as security
		    - **Collateral monitoring:** Lenders can demand additional collateral or reduce loan amounts if collateral values decline.
		    - **Purpose:** Ensure recoverable assets are available in case of default.
		- **Staged Financing**
			- **Milestone‐based disbursements:** e.g. releasing R&D funding in phases upon achieving agreed milestones
			- **Enhanced transparency:** Borrowers report and verify progress at each stage
		    - **Purpose:** Reduce early‐stage uncertainty and encourage proper use of funds.
		- **Credit Assessment & Third‐Party Verification**
		    - **Credit‐rating agency reports:** Use external credit scores and evaluations
		    - **Due diligence:** Conduct audits or on‑site inspections to uncover financial or operational risks
		    - **Purpose:** Detect information distortion or omission before committing capital.
