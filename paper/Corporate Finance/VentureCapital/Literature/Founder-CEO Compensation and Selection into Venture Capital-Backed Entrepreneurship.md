## 💭 Summary
1. founder-CEOs of VC-backed startups have low pay for only a while
2. a tangible product (“product-market fit”) dramatically increases liquid cash compensation
3. “Product market fit” also coincides with key human capital in the startup becoming more replaceable.

## 🧭 Research Overview
- **Research Question**:  
  How does founder-CEO compensation influence the selection of high-earning individuals into VC-backed entrepreneurship?

- **Hypothesis**:  
  The expected time to initial product development shapes founder compensation risks, influencing who chooses to become a founder.

- **Motivation**:  
  Despite extensive work on capital frictions in startups, little research examines supply-side constraints — especially how compensation risk deters high-income individuals from founding VC-backed startups.

## 📊 Data & Methodology
- **Data Source(s)**:  
  Advanced HR surveys (2015, 2017), VentureSource, LinkedIn career histories, IRS & ACS data, Compensation Pro, IPO filings, Execucomp

- **Sample**:  
  U.S. VC-backed tech startups founded after 1996; focus on founder-CEOs

- **Methodology**:
  - Empirical: Poisson regressions on founder compensation and turnover
  - Theoretical: Dynamic consumption-savings model (extension of Hall & Woodward, 2010)
  - Natural experiment: Cloud computing shock in 2006 (difference-in-differences)

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Founder-CEO compensation increases sharply after product development (from ~$85K to ~$165K or more).
- Time to product development is a **key determinant** of non-diversifiable risk and attractiveness of entrepreneurship.
- Industries with faster product cycles (e.g., software post-cloud computing) attract significantly more high-income founders.
- Compensation contracts evolve from “entrepreneur” (low salary) to “manager” (higher salary) post-product.
- Founder-CEO replacement risk rises after product development.

---

## 🧠 Theoretical Framework
- Extension of Hall & Woodward (2010) model: introduces two-stage (pre-/post-product) compensation and endogenous product transition.
- Utility model captures consumption smoothing with risk aversion and liquidity constraints.

---

## 🎯 Contribution to Literature
- Novel insight into how **expected time to product** governs entrepreneurial selection.
- Quantifies impact of compensation transitions on high-skill entry into startups.
- Highlights VC’s role as **intermediate liquidity providers**, not just capital sources.
- Provides policy-relevant insight into “missing entrepreneurs” among high earners.

## ⚖️ Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**:
  - Combines theory, empirical data, and natural experiment
  - Uses rich proprietary data on compensation and founder transitions
  - Insightful calibration of risk model with real-world parameters

- **Limitations / Concerns**:
  - Focuses mostly on tech/startups; less generalizable to non-VC entrepreneurship
  - Model assumptions (e.g., salary thresholds, independence of income/wealth) may oversimplify heterogeneity
  - Entry constraints may also be shaped by non-monetary preferences, not modeled

## 🔗 Related Works
- Builds on:  
  - Hall & Woodward (2010), Rajan (2012), Edmans et al. (2012)
  - Ewens, Nanda, Rhodes-Kropf (2018), Gompers et al. (2005)

- Contrasts with:  
  - Papers assuming fixed compensation or homogenous selection

---

## 💡 Notes & Future Questions
- Could similar compensation structuring reduce entry barriers in non-tech sectors?
- What policies (e.g., income smoothing loans or insurance) could alleviate risk?
- Role of “joiners” vs founders: non-founders are less likely to join due to lower pay/equity.
- What does this imply about diversity and inequality in high-growth entrepreneurship?
