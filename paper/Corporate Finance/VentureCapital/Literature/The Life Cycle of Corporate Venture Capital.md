## üß† Summary  
This paper establishes the "life cycle" of Corporate Venture Capital (CVC)‚Äîfrom initiation, operation, to termination‚Äîwithin U.S. public firms. It argues that CVCs are used strategically to acquire external knowledge in response to declining internal innovation. CVCs are temporary programs initiated to fix weaknesses in innovation capabilities and are typically terminated when the parent firm‚Äôs innovation improves.

## üß≠ Research Overview  
- **Research Question**:  
  What motivates firms to start, operate, and terminate Corporate Venture Capital units, and how does CVC affect corporate innovation?

- **Hypotheses**:  
  - Firms initiate CVC following deterioration in internal innovation.  
  - CVC investments aim to acquire complementary innovation knowledge.  
  - CVCs are terminated once the innovation goals are fulfilled.

- **Motivation**:  
  CVC is a growing but understudied form of corporate investment. Understanding its strategic function helps explain how incumbent firms adapt to innovation shocks using external entrepreneurial knowledge.

## üìä Data & Methodology  
- **Data Source(s)**:  
  - Hand-collected sample of 381 U.S. CVC units (1980‚Äì2006) from VentureXpert  
  - Matched to Compustat, CRSP, NBER patent data  
  - Patent citation analysis to trace knowledge flows  

- **Sample**:  
  CVC programs affiliated with non-financial public firms in the U.S.

- **Methodology**:  
  - Panel regressions  
  - Hazard models for CVC termination  
  - Patent citation-based innovation tracking  
  - Identification via exogenous knowledge obsolescence

---

## üìà Key Findings  
- CVC entry probability increases after a decline in firm-level patent output and quality.  
- CVCs prefer startups with related technologies but distinct knowledge bases.  
- Patent citations to CVC-backed startups rise after investment, suggesting knowledge transfer.  
- CVC investments increase firm innovation and acquisition efficiency.  
- Median life span of CVC is ~4 years; termination is driven by innovation recovery‚Äînot IPOs or acquisitions.

---

## üß† Theoretical Framework  
- **Framework**: Innovation as a two-stage process: (1) information acquisition; (2) implementation (Nelson 1982; Jovanovic and Rob 1989)  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - Innovation knowledge is partially external and transferable  
  - CVC provides access to complementary innovation  
  - Strategic (not purely financial) motives drive CVC investments

---

## üéØ Contribution to Literature  
- Provides the first empirical model of the **CVC life cycle**  
- Supports the "fixing weaknesses" view of CVC, in contrast to the "building on strengths" perspective  
- Highlights the role of **information acquisition** in organizing corporate innovation  

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Strengths and Weaknesses  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Unique dataset on CVC activities  
  - Novel identification of innovation shocks  
  - Integrates patent and financial data  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Focuses only on U.S. public firms  
  - Does not directly evaluate startup outcomes  
  - Strategic motives may be heterogeneous and context-specific

## üí° Notes & Future Questions  
- Can CVC structure (e.g., governance, compensation) influence knowledge absorption?  
- How does CVC compare to other external innovation modes (M&A, alliances)?  
- Can the life-cycle logic extend to university-corporate partnerships?
