## 🧠 Summary  
This paper develops a general equilibrium model of the venture capital (VC) market where VCs are scarce relative to entrepreneurs. The model explains why VC-backed firms tend to outperform solo entrepreneurs, not due to active value-adding by VCs, but because VCs select higher-quality projects and exit underperformers earlier due to their opportunity cost. Simple equity contracts emerge as bilaterally efficient. The model is calibrated using U.S. data (1989–1993), estimating an 8.6% excess return to VC, and 0–3.5% returns for solo entrepreneurs.

## 🧭 Research Overview  
- **Research Question**:  
  What drives the excess return to venture capital, and how does scarcity of VCs influence market efficiency?

- **Hypotheses**:  
  - Scarcity of VCs leads to selection of high-quality ventures and early termination of weak ones.  
  - Simple equity contracts can deliver efficient outcomes despite moral hazard.

- **Motivation**:  
  Empirical findings show that VC-backed startups outperform solo ventures. The paper provides a structural explanation via endogenous market equilibrium and selection.

## 📊 Data & Methodology  
- **Data Source(s)**:  
  VentureXpert database: 952 U.S. VC-backed companies founded 1989–1993

- **Methodology**:  
  - General equilibrium model of matching and optimal termination  
  - Structural estimation and calibration using project-level and macro data  
  - Focus on project success hazard and VC termination behavior  
  - Simulations to match observed IPO values, exit timing, and “J-curve” investment returns

---

## 📈 Key Findings  
- VC-backed firms yield **8.6% excess return**, driven by selection and early exit  
- Solo entrepreneurs yield **0–3.5%** depending on their wealth constraints  
- VC selection thresholds are stricter than those of solo entrepreneurs  
- VCs terminate earlier due to opportunity cost, increasing average IPO value  
- Simple equity contracts maximize joint surplus and are endogenously optimal

---

## 🧠 Theoretical Framework  
- Continuous-time model with moral hazard: effort and investment unobservable  
- VCs match one-to-one with entrepreneurs, select projects post signal of value  
- Bell-shaped hazard rate of project success  
- Equilibrium defined by market-clearing in the supply/demand of VC contracts  
- Bilaterally efficient equity-sharing contracts distribute surplus proportionally to cost contributions

---

## 🎯 Contribution to Literature  
- First general equilibrium model of the venture capital market  
- Explains selection as the dominant mechanism, not value-add  
- Justifies widespread use of **simple equity contracts** in VC financing  
- Bridges finance, matching theory, and entrepreneurship models

---

## ⚖️ Strengths and Weaknesses  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Rich structural model capturing dynamic VC-entrepreneur matching  
  - Empirically calibrated to historical data  
  - Theoretical insights into contract design and VC selectivity

- **Limitations**:  
  - Ignores heterogeneity in project sectors or founders' human capital  
  - Perfect signal assumption (though relaxed in appendix)  
  - No explicit modeling of multi-round funding or staged investment

## 💡 Notes & Future Questions  
- Can multi-stage funding improve efficiency further than equity-only contracts?  
- How does VC scarcity evolve over cycles? What about LP constraints?  
- Policy implications: reducing barriers to VC entry may lower selection thresholds and improve inclusivity
