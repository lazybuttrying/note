## üß† Summary  
This short but influential paper synthesizes empirical findings from Kaplan and Str√∂mberg‚Äôs research on how venture capitalists mitigate agency problems. It focuses on three key mechanisms: sophisticated **contract design**, **screening** of investment opportunities, and **post-investment monitoring and advising**. Venture capitalists allocate cash-flow and control rights dynamically, depending on observable performance. Contracts are incomplete but heavily state-contingent.

## üß≠ Research Overview  
- **Research Question**:  
  How do VCs address the classic principal-agent problems in startup financing through contracting, screening, and monitoring?

- **Hypotheses**:  
  - VC contracts allocate rights based on performance.  
  - Screening and initial evaluation significantly influence contract structure.  
  - Monitoring is selective and tied to anticipated risk.

- **Motivation**:  
  Though financial contracting theory is well developed, empirical testing of these models in real-world VC settings was limited prior to this work.

## üìä Data & Methodology  
- **Data Source(s)**:  
  - 213 VC contracts across 119 portfolio companies from 14 VC firms  
  - 58 investment memos from 10 firms covering 42 companies  
  - Supplemented with performance and business plan data

- **Methodology**:  
  Descriptive empirical analysis focusing on contract structure, screening memos, and performance expectations

## üìà Key Findings  
- VC contracts allocate **cash-flow, control, voting, board, and liquidation rights** separately  
- Contracts are **contingent** on firm performance (financial and non-financial)  
- **Convertible preferred stock** is common, often used in "participating" form  
- **Control rights shift** to the entrepreneur as performance improves  
- **Vesting and noncompete clauses** are more common in early-stage deals  
- Screening identifies **management team quality** as the most cited risk  
- VCs use contract terms (e.g., staged financing, board control) to **mitigate perceived risk**  
- Monitoring includes shaping the team, providing strategic help, but is limited by VC time constraints

---

## üß† Theoretical Framework  
- Principal-agent theory (e.g., Holmstr√∂m, 1979; Harris & Raviv, 1979)  
- Incomplete contracting (Grossman & Hart, 1986; Hart & Moore, 1990)  
- Control and cash flow rights allocated to reflect risk, stage, and information asymmetry  
- Contracting complements investor action: contracting, screening, and monitoring are interrelated

---

## üéØ Contribution to Literature  
- Strong empirical support for **state-contingent contracting**  
- Demonstrates real-world relevance of **incomplete contract theory**  
- Shows that cash-flow and control rights are **complements**, not substitutes  
- Highlights the role of **ex ante screening** and **ex post monitoring** in shaping investment terms

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Strengths and Weaknesses  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Rare access to detailed VC contracts and memos  
  - Links empirical patterns directly to theory  
  - Clearly structured around contracting, screening, and monitoring

- **Limitations**:  
  - Snapshot nature (small sample, early 2000s)  
  - Descriptive rather than causal  
  - Short format limits methodological depth

## üí° Notes & Future Questions  
- How do modern contract structures differ in tech-focused or global VC contexts?  
- To what extent do VCs rely on soft vs. hard information in screening?  
- What are the time tradeoffs in VC monitoring today (given larger portfolios)?
