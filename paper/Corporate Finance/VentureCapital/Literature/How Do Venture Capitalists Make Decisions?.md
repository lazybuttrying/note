## 🧠 Summary  
This paper surveys 885 institutional venture capitalists (VCs) to analyze their investment decision-making across stages: sourcing, selection, valuation, contracting, and post-investment value creation. The study distinguishes the relative importance of each component and examines which factors predict success or failure, emphasizing the central role of the founding team.

## 🧭 Research Overview  
- **Research Question**:  
  How do venture capitalists make investment decisions—particularly regarding sourcing, evaluation, valuation, and post-investment involvement?

- **Hypotheses**:  
  Deal selection is more important than sourcing and post-investment involvement; management teams are the most critical driver of investment outcomes.

- **Motivation**:  
  Existing theory and empirical literature lacked micro-level evidence on VC decision processes. This survey addresses the empirical gap and informs both academic theory and practitioner insight.

## 📊 Data & Methodology  
- **Data Source(s)**:  
  Survey data from 885 VCs across 681 firms + 29 follow-up interviews  
- **Sample**:  
  U.S. institutional VCs, collected in 2015–2016  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Structured survey based on Kaplan & Strömberg (2001)  
  - Analysis across subsamples (stage, geography, fund size, industry)  
  - Matched to VentureSource data

---

## 📈 Key Findings  
- VCs screen ~100 deals per investment; most deal flow comes via networks  
- **Selection (49%) > Value-add (27%) > Deal flow (23%)** for value creation  
- **Team quality** = key driver of success and failure (95%+)  
- DCF/NPV rarely used; MOIC (63%) and IRR (42%) are preferred  
- 20% of VCs do not forecast cash flows at all  
- Strong post-investment engagement: weekly+ contact, support in strategy, hiring, fundraising

---

## 🧠 Theoretical Framework  
- **Framework**: Principal-agent theory; resolving asymmetric information through contracts  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - Entrepreneurs have ideas but lack capital  
  - VCs monitor, contract, and advise to align incentives and manage risk

---

## 🎯 Contribution to Literature  
- Distinguishes empirically between deal sourcing and selection  
- Shows divergence between real-world VC practice and textbook finance (NPV, CAPM)  
- Offers comprehensive evidence on what VCs actually do (pre/post investment)

---

## ⚖️ Strengths and Weaknesses  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Largest VC survey to date  
  - High-quality sample (top-tier VCs)  
  - Cross-validation with external data

- **Limitations**:  
  - Sample bias toward successful firms (Harvard, Stanford, Chicago MBAs)  
  - Self-reporting may include perception bias

- How does VC compensation structure affect decision quality?  
- Can AI replicate sourcing and screening functions?  
- How do LP reporting standards shape valuation behavior?
